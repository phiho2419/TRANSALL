1
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,645
Space. What is it?

2
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,204
The simple answer is we don't know

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,928
Or at least we didn't know until now.

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,487
Hello, I'm Douglas Reynholm
and I'm not a scientist,

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,285
but I do have a better understanding
of what space is

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,687
than any scientist living today.

7
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,166
Where did I gain these insights?
From this man.

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,330
The founder of Spaceology,
Beth Gaga Shaggy,

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,849
no relation to either Lady Gaga
or Shaggy,

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,361
is the founder of Spaceology,

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,608
a religion, not a cult.

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,722
In other words, when it comes to space,

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,286
he's the man with his head
screwed on tight.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,325
This is what he told me
when I met him on holiday two weeks ago.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,770
Space is invisible mind dust
and stars are but wishes.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,850
I mean, think about that!

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,850
That means every star
you can see in the night sky

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,167
is a wish that has come true.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,849
And they've come true because of
something he calls Spacestar Ordering.

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,760
Spacestar Ordering is based
on the twin scientific principles

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,690
of star maths and wishy thinking.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,286
If you'd like to know more,

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,007
there are thousands of
Spaceology centres all over the UK.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,330
If that doesn't convince you,

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,842
well, then, maybe you just don't deserve
to get what you want.

26
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,371
Ding!

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,083
Wow. You're a genius, Ray!
Love the special effects!

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,362
How did you do that thing
where I'm spinning around?

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,201
Well, in that... In that bit,
you're actually spinning around.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,810
Well, I'm glad you like
the website, Mr Reynholm,

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,649
I did spend quite a lot of time on it.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,082
It's brilliant, and well worth
every penny of the £50.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,441
Hundred... Didn't we say £100?

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,161
I never would have agreed to that.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,646
Ah, Jen!

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,001
Guess who wanted a helicopter
this time last week

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,124
and now, thanks to Spacestar Ordering,
has one?

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,567
You?

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,729
I'll give you a clue,
it ain't these chaps!

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,567
You?

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,121
You're a sceptic, Jen.
You should be more like these.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,971
They can't get enough
of my Spacestar Ordering story.

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,323
Yes, yes, I noticed
you've been coming down here

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,887
a lot more often
because of all the questions.

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,001
So, Mr Reynholm, how did the cosmos
grant you a helicopter?

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,644
Well, I visualised the thing I wanted.
In my case, it was a helicopter.

47
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,890
I drew a picture of the helicopter
on a piece of paper,

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,130
then I stood with my back to space,
threw the paper over my shoulder

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,810
and wished really hard.

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,400
But when you say that you stood
with your back to space...

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,488
- Yes.
- How exactly did you achieve that?

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,568
I waited till night-time.

53
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,091
Of course.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,531
Couple of days later,
bought myself a helicopter.

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,802
Explain that one, if you can.

56
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,443
I wish the cosmos would make it
slightly harder to find our office.

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,040
Don't worry, Jen, you'll get your wish,

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,891
just as one day I'll get my robot hand.

59
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,569
Scientific mind,
believes in Spacestar Ordering.

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,200
Who's getting the robot hand first?

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,365
Hey, you're still up for tonight, right?

62
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,686
I'll go if Moss goes.

63
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,883
Sorry, Jen.
I find music confusing and annoying.

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,601
Roy invited me to a gig once.
I didn't really enjoy it.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,406
You went to the wrong address!
You went to a swimming pool.

66
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,403
Are you sure it's not swimming pools
that you find confusing and annoying?

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,209
You're right.
It's not music I hate, it's swimming!

68
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,327
You know what? I will come, Roy.

69
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,280
Where's Moss? I can't believe
he's missing out on this!

70
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,045
Where are they?

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,167
I'm going to have to go and dance
up the front.

72
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,568
- Aren't you a bit old for the front?
- I'm 31 .

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,364
Good for you, mate!

74
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,368
Careful! My foot!

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,805
Will you chill? Will you chill out, man?

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,200
Ow! Jesus Chr...

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,967
Get out of town!

78
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,286
You hooked up with someone
from the band?

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,640
- Yeah.
- Wow, who was it?

80
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,730
- Norman.
- Norman? Oh, he's the drummer, right?

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,729
The keyboard player.

82
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,929
The keyboard player?

83
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,201
Okay.

84
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,210
- What?
- No, it's just...

85
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,687
The keyboard player? Really?

86
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,291
- Yeah, what?
- Well, it's just...

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,006
He's a bit geeky, isn't he, Jen?
I didn't think that was your type.

88
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,282
Jen's going out with a geek!

89
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,641
Are you sure it's not just
because he's in a band?

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,650
Yes. I really am that shallow, Roy.

91
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,204
- I know you are.
- Yeah, I'm that shallow.

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,130
You are, though.
I mean, you really, really are!

93
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,969
Look, I... I like him.

94
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,606
He doesn't say a lot,
he's more of a thinker.

95
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,051
I think he's really cool.

96
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,801
It's because he's in a band!
Oh, flippin' hell.

97
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,844
- Is this your back again?
- When did mosh pits become so unruly?

98
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,610
I told you, you should get a massage.

99
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,405
Oh, I've never enjoyed having massages.

100
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,570
I don't like being naked
in front of strangers.

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,605
And I can never relax if I think
someone might play Norah Jones.

102
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,003
Who wants to hear another
Spacestar Ordering success story?

103
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,930
Oh, wait, wait! Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay.

104
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,881
Go!

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,961
Right. Last week, I decided I wanted
to learn how to do tattoos.

106
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,730
So, I did the business,

107
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,323
bought a book on tattoos, read it
and now I know how to do tattoos. Look!

108
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,642
- My helicopter!
-  Oh!

109
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,922
- Oh, that's brilliant.
- Let me see... Oh!

110
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,451
What the bloody hell's wrong with you?

111
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,086
Oh, no, I have a really bad back.

112
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,089
You should see a masseuse.

113
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,202
Don't see a masseuse!

114
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,884
They're the biggest con
of the 20th century.

115
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,284
I had a bad back and I cured it,
thanks to the techniques outlined

116
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,246
in this groundbreaking exposé
of the massage industry.

117
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,371
Go like this.

118
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,249
And push your back up.

119
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,609
Oh, for... Oh!

120
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,726
- That's worse! That's way worse.
- It's terrible, isn't it?

121
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,171
You told me that would make it better!

122
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,568
No, no, no!
That's how I originally injured my back.

123
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,649
- You all right?
- Yeah, feels so much better already.

124
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,809
So that's why I ended up
joining the parachute regiment.

125
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,845
Ah, yeah, the Paras...
That's the one I would have joined.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,241
But you know, fear of heights.

127
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,046
- Were you in the army?
- No.

128
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,885
Oh!

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,446
Right, I'll do a little bit of work
on your thighs.

130
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,325
Oh, yeah, hey,
you do what you need to do.

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,570
Did you see that ludicrous display
last night?

132
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,527
What was Mancini thinking, eh?

133
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,089
The thing about Arsenal is,
they always try to walk it in.

134
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,406
Arsenal?

135
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,048
Whoever we're talking about.

136
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,203
Ah! Nearly done.

137
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,601
Oh...

138
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,761
Oh, thanks again, man,
this really does feel so much better.

139
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,250
- Right.
- Oh, yeah.

140
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,170
There we are. All finished!

141
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,089
Mwah!

142
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,724
# I love him,
I love him, I love him so... #

143
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,885
Goodness me!

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,446
What... What... What would you term
what just happened there?

145
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,369
Norman says my voice is extraordinary.

146
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,285
He's right.

147
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,042
Oh, this is it, you know.
This is the guy. This is the big one.

148
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,365
There's nothing about him I don't like.

149
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,487
When he's asleep, he makes this sound,
a lovely little gentle purr.

150
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,285
-- Oh, that...

151
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,884
Oh!

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,764
This is a long song.

153
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,243
Do you know, the last few days
have been indescribable.

154
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,441
Good.

155
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,050
Oh. Hi, Roy!

156
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,366
Hi, Roy.

157
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,201
What?

158
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,806
You okay?

159
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,121
What?

160
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,170
Are you all right?

161
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,127
Is your back still hurting?
Didn't you go to see the masseuse?

162
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,605
Yes, I did.

163
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,645
Did it help?

164
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,007
No.

165
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,600
Are you okay?

166
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,563
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

167
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,563
It's just that you've got the same face
that you have when you eat vegetables.

168
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,966
Okay.

169
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,289
Something happened.

170
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,851
Something happened?

171
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,921
Yes. When I was getting the massage,
the masseuse did something.

172
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,046
Go on.

173
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,762
Okay, I'm going to tell you,

174
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,565
but you have to promise
not to laugh at me,

175
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,126
because this whole thing
has left me very shaken.

176
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,050
Okay. I promise I will not laugh.

177
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,446
Okay.

178
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,488
He kissed me on the arse.

179
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,605
Sorry, I may have
misheard you there, Roy.

180
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,010
What did you just say?

181
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,331
I was enjoying the massage,
everything had gone very, very well,

182
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,525
but then, at the end,
he just leaned down

183
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,246
and he gave me a big kiss on the arse.

184
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,120
And you thought I'd find that funny?

185
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,523
Well, yeah, I suppose I did.

186
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,086
On what planet would that be funny?

187
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,811
Whereabouts on the arse did he kiss you?

188
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,764
I don't know, just to the left of the...
The line that goes down the middle.

189
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,726
- The cleftal horizon.
- Is that what it's called?

190
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,525
Yes, it is, but never mind that.
What happened next?

191
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,201
Well, then I just got dressed
and I left.

192
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,851
Okay. Okay.

193
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,041
Have you told Jen this?

194
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,367
No, I was really afraid
she'd laugh at me.

195
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,166
Do you think Jen's a monster?
She wouldn't laugh!

196
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,645
This man crossed the line.

197
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,330
He is a member of
the medical profession.

198
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,010
Roy, look at me.

199
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,924
Look at me.

200
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,051
There is nothing funny about this.

201
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,329
I think he crossed the line.
I don't think it's funny.

202
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,287
I mean, I was so relaxed and then
that just tensed me right up again.

203
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,646
My hands were like that for an hour.

204
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,409
I couldn't get them into my pockets
to pay him.

205
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,325
You paid him?

206
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,122
Roy, I've got to tell you,
I think you've got grounds to sue.

207
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,241
Really?

208
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,805
What is that?

209
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,369
That's Jen. That's what she does now.

210
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,448
You should tell her.
You should tell her.

211
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,369
- What?
- Listen to this.

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,002
Jen, you know that I went
for that massage?

213
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,771
- Yeah.
- You are not going to believe this.

214
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,282
The bloke who did it
kissed me on my arse.

215
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,126
Whoa.

216
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,607
No, Jen, my masseuse
kissed me on my bum!

217
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,885
My body went into spasms!

218
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,088
My hands were like this for an hour!

219
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,168
Stop it! You're killing me!

220
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,329
You've got to spread
that kind of material out!

221
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,924
I can't believe this!

222
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,841
So what's the problem?

223
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,361
I know! He doesn't write,
he doesn't call...

224
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,922
What, did you think
he was coming on to you?

225
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,041
I don't know!

226
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,687
Oh, maybe he's like the Michelangelo
of physical therapists

227
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,361
and that is his signature.
Maybe he does it to everybody.

228
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,564
Look, to be honest,
I don't care why he did it.

229
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,600
All I know is that I was vulnerable.

230
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,363
I was naked
and he kissed me on my bottom.

231
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,485
And I'll tell you something.

232
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,489
This is not the last
that he has heard of me.

233
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,047
As God is my witness,
no man shall ever have to be kissed

234
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,164
on his bottom unexpectedly
because of this man ever again!

235
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,169
Will you stop laughing?

236
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,161
This is the first time
I've left before you.

237
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,046
We're looking up legal precedents
of Roy being kissed on the arse.

238
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,561
Don't sue him, Roy.
You'll get on the news.

239
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,887
- Don't listen to her.
- Everyone will laugh!

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,891
No one will laugh! Come on, Jen.
Help us bring this monster to justice!

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,967
I can't.

242
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,731
The band are playing a new song tonight,
they want my opinion.

243
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,763
You know to just say it's great, right?

244
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,327
Roy, I am a person,
with thoughts and opinions.

245
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,250
No. You're not.

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,889
Jen, please, just say it's great.

247
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,809
When people like that ask you
what you think,

248
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,526
all they actually want to hear
is that they're geniuses.

249
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,926
Goodbye.

250
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,691
She is evil.

251
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,487
Spacestar Ordering success story
number three.

252
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,805
My tattoo got infected,
so they've had to cut off my arm!

253
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,566
I am getting a robot hand!

254
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,040
# In the water

255
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,163
# I am beautiful #

256
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,361
Beautiful. Really beautiful.

257
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,686
Thank you.

258
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,566
It's just a great song.
Really, really great.

259
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,566
If you put a gun to my head
and forced me to give one criticism,

260
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,603
it'd be that maybe it goes on
just a bit too long.

261
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,688
Apart from that, perfect.

262
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,881
Okay.

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,367
Listen, Tim, Mary's not
going to make it tonight.

264
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,641
What are we going
to do about backing vocals?

265
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,683
Oh! Oh, I'd love to!

266
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,321
Moss, can I ask you a question?

267
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,761
Sure.

268
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,884
Do I have to testify?

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,571
I can't make that decision for you, Roy.

270
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,251
You've just got to ask yourself
one thing.

271
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,762
If you don't take the stand,
how many more unsolicited bum kisses

272
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,929
will be administered
by that lip-happy bastard?

273
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,280
No, you're right, I know you're right.
I do want to testify.

274
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,483
I'm just afraid that
they're all going to laugh at me.

275
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,762
What if they're all...
What if they're all like Jen?

276
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,201
They're not going to laugh, Roy.

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,446
No one's like Jen. No one.

278
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,562
I've come to realise she's actually
a very odd person.

279
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,128
Wow. Well, good luck tonight, everyone!

280
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,290
Are you a big Stevie Nicks fan, Jen?

281
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,370
Stevie Nicks? Yeah, yeah. Oh, God.

282
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,245
Thanks so much for this, guys.
I'm so excited.

283
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,170
I've never done anything
like this before.

284
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,966
I can't believe you want me to do it!

285
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,121
I won't let you down.

286
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,562
So, Norman, we've had a talk.

287
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,561
And we think we're going to go back
to not having a keyboard in the band.

288
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,806
Oh, no!

289
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,083
Yeah, I'm sorry but...
We'll see you both again soon, yeah?

290
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,089
Wait! I'm out, too?

291
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,967
And the defendant gave no indication

292
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,527
that he had any intention
of kissing you on the bottom?

293
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,161
No indication whatsoever.
He just kissed me on my bottom.

294
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,810
Out of nowhere.

295
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,964
What was the result?

296
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,049
Well, I had nightmares about it.
And I can't stop washing my bottom.

297
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,331
And I find it hard to trust masseurs.

298
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,161
Where exactly did he kiss you?

299
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,922
- It was in the middle.
- In the middle of your bottom?

300
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,965
Well, just to the left
of the cleftal horizon.

301
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,526
In layman's terms, please, Mr Trenneman.

302
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,440
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honour.
Just to the left of the bum line.

303
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,124
Just above the thigh?

304
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,642
Well above the thigh.
It was on my bottom.

305
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,523
Although it is true, is it not,

306
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,450
that what some people
might call their bottom,

307
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,608
others might call their hip?

308
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,121
No, he kissed my bottom, sir.

309
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,449
- But is it not true...
- He kissed me on my bottom!

310
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,001
Why... Why... Why is no one laughing?

311
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,848
It's no laughing matter, Jen.

312
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,442
We Spaceologists take
this kind of thing very seriously.

313
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,962
Oh. Are all these people Spaceologists?

314
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,880
Yes, this trial could bring
the massage industry to its knees.

315
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,131
And you'll find they take this case
with the gravity it deserves.

316
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,730
Perhaps Mr Trenneman might be able
to help us with the aid of this diagram.

317
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,162
Could you please place
this picture of the defendant

318
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,448
on the area where you say he kissed you?

319
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,801
That was where the incident happened.
I think that's accurate.

320
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,048
- Oh, you think that is accurate?
- Yes.

321
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,844
Oh, because only a moment ago
you were quite sure,

322
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,166
yet now you only think.

323
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,645
You're twisting my words.

324
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,401
Is it not true that this
may simply be an artist

325
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,569
proud of his work,
signing off with a flourish?

326
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,041
That is not the point.

327
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,162
Yes, thank you, Mr Trenneman.
That will be all.

328
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,964
My arse is not a canvas!

329
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,606
I said, that will be all, thank you.

330
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,326
My bottom is not a kissing post, sir.

331
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,561
Okay, you can dress this up
however you like

332
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,331
with your fancy words,
but the truth remains

333
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,807
that that man sitting there

334
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,165
kissed me on my bike rack
and I was not expecting it,

335
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,886
and it rendered
an expensive massage worthless.

336
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,967
Your Honour, please...

337
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,880
And I am here today
so that no man need be kissed

338
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,686
on his sweetmeats
by this man ever again,

339
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,121
unless they have arranged it beforehand
for some reason.

340
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,730
Will you be silent?

341
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,162
I will not be silent!
I will never be silent!

342
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,841
I will not stop until those lips
are behind bars.

343
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,811
How dare you? I trusted you.

344
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,811
My trouser hams are not for sale, sir!

345
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,088
I put my arse in your hands.

346
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,370
I rest my case.

347
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,411
I'd have used my robot hand for good.

348
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,600
Wake up!
