1
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,522
All right! OK!

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,128
All right! Yes! OK!

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,809
Whoa!

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,489
I know you wanna party
but I have to say thank you to a few people

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,082
after what has been a momentous week
for this company.

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,647
Project Icarus has increased
our productivity tenfold.

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,843
Every department is working
at three times usual speed

8
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,000
due to the increased inter connectivity
of our computer system.

9
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,487
Brilliant! Brilliant! OK!

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,286
How can I talk about
all that computer stuff,

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,971
all of that computer gobbledegook,

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,811
without saying a word about...

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,410
the lawyers?

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,482
They cut the red tape. They cut the red
tape. They cut the red tape. Come on! Yes!

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,969
You cut it. You cut it.
You cut it. You cut it. You cut it.

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,969
That's enough.

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,085
And when you're talking about computers,
how can you fail to mention...

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,565
Accounts?

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,886
Yes!

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,243
He's building up to us.
He must be.

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,247
And finally, last but not least...
Champagne?

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,527
These three people
proved time and again

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,962
that they have the right stuff.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,450
The toilet cleaners!

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,328
They said we couldn't do it.

26
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,649
They said outsourcing our toilet cleaning
would be inefficient.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,321
Dirk, Banhead and Doodles
proved them wrong.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,610
- Toilets!
- That's right, Doodles.

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,844
- Where are you going?
- They do this every time.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,883
They never remember us.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,844
But you did the work.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,008
We did all the work.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,571
So does this mean
we're not going to the thank-you party?

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,651
Of course we're not going to the thank-you
party. Why would we? We weren't thanked.

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,521
Hello, IT. Have you tried
turning it off and on again?

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,042
Have you tried sticking it up your arse?

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,606
Oh... Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,087
I just realised that was my mother.

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,248
Oh, and I was really looking forward
to that, you know. Fancied a dance.

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,762
I'm glad the toilet guys got the
nod, though. They do good work.

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,771
Have you been to the toilets on 12th?
It's like going on holiday.

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,963
I try not to go at home now.
I save it up.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,326
Oh, Jesus! Will you please
do something about that poster?

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,284
- What poster?
- Bloody drawer!

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,641
That one, the one with the monkey.
It's horrible.

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,683
The monkey?
What's wrong with the monkey?

47
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,441
He's not horrible. He's lovely.
He's a lovely little monkey.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,847
What's he doing in goal?

49
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,521
Not that monkey. That monkey.

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,001
Oh, right.
That is a bit frightening.

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,170
Anyway, I'd better fix this drawer.
Moss, do you have the hammer?

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,411
You're not listening to me!
I hate it when people don't listen to me!

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,841
- Whoa. Hey.
- God. That was harsh.

54
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,248
- High-end screeching.
- Like someone's killing a cat in here.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,523
- Some kind of shouty cat.
- Oh, God.

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,530
I'm so... I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,361
I'm just... I'm just a little bit...
You know, you know.

58
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,084
What? What?

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,283
Well, I've got... you know,
at the moment, so...

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,243
What?

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
I've got Aunt Irma visiting.

62
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,567
Oh.

63
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,651
Do you not like Aunt Irma?
I've got... I've got an aunt like that.

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,047
It's my turn for...

65
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,083
my time of the month.

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,611
Oh.

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,291
- What time of the month? The weekend?
- No.

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,926
- Does Aunt Irma visit on the weekend?
- Moss...

69
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,203
- You know, it's high tide.
- But we're not on the coast.

70
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,766
- Moss!
- I'm closed for maintenance.

71
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,689
- Closed for maintenance?
- Moss!

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,485
I've fallen to the communists.

73
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,850
Well, they do have
some strong arguments.

74
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,770
<i>Carrie,</i> Moss.
First scene in <i>Carrie.</i>

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,610
Oh... OK.

76
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,688
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,802
No, no.

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,605
Yeah. No, uh-uh.

79
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,086
Yeah. You know, I... People tell me
I'm not great during this time,

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,248
so, uh, I thought I should warn you.

81
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,045
- Right. Not great in what way?
- Just generally.

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,324
I'm not great to be around,
so try not to get on my nerves.

83
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,364
Hey, I've had a few girlfriends.
I'm not completely oblivious.

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,687
- You won't even know I'm here.
- OK.

85
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,969
Oh, when this is working right
the action on it is so great.

86
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,731
Look at that. So smooth.

87
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,241
Stop doing that!

88
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,809
Oh, my God! Sorry. Sorry, but you see
what I mean. You have to be careful.

89
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,526
Yeah. I'll be careful.

90
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,600
- Has she gone yet?
- Yeah. Um...

91
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,760
What was all that about?
God. Dear me. Ladies. God bless 'em.

92
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,566
What would we do without them,
with their ways,

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,604
their mysterious seasons,

94
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,087
the moon, Glenn Close,

95
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,046
Sheena Easton,
all the different kinds of women?

96
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,243
Oh, smashing.

97
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,204
Oh, my appointment.
I've got to go and see the psychiatrist.

98
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,527
I can't believe
there's a psychiatrist in the building.

99
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,291
All because those two from Accounts
just had enough of everything

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,243
and wanted to go to the seaside.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,445
The seaside?
They committed suicide, Roy.

102
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,648
That's right. Yes, of course.
Why do you have to go and see her?

103
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,845
- Oh. Because I said Jen was dead that time.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. That'll be it.

104
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,443
She said it was something
only a severely disturbed person would do,

105
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,530
and that now I have to spend
a lot of time in therapy.

106
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,962
- Isn't that great?
- Oh, well, yes, that's clearly terrific.

107
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,731
No. No, that's bad.
Why do you think that's great?

108
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,890
The psychiatrist is a very attractive lady.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,483
- Ah, I see. She's of the female...
- Genre? Yes.

110
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,080
A Dr Melfi to your Tony Soprano.

111
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,410
- She's a glamorous older woman.
- Oh, the things you could learn from her.

112
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,887
Or from any woman.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,651
Is Jen in her office?
I need her to sign something.

114
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,651
Um, yeah. Um, Moss, Moss,
don't get on her nerves.

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,762
How would I get on her nerves?

116
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,206
- Hello.
- What do you want?!

117
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,806
Shouldn't I be on the couch?

118
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,288
No, Maurice, not today.
I've got some good news.

119
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,847
- I think you've turned a corner.
- I'm not going on the couch?

120
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,611
- You don't need me any more, Moss.
- What?

121
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,768
There's obviously nothing wrong with you,

122
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,124
and I think you're ready now
to do without our sessions.

123
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,601
But I've been feeling depressed.

124
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,848
Oh, really? Why?

125
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,728
- Because I'm pregnant.
- What?

126
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,731
I mean, I... I had a dream
that I was pregnant.

127
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,764
Well, there's nothing unusual about that.

128
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,410
But when I had the baby, I looked
down and saw that it was my father.

129
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,041
- That's normal, Moss.
- What? Really?

130
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,768
That was the maddest thing I could think
of. My mother? What if it had two heads?

131
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,727
Moss, listen. I think you're fine, and there
are other people here who need me more.

132
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,128
But I've been having dark thoughts.

133
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,680
- Dark thoughts?
- Yes. Thoughts about dark things.

134
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,723
What sort of dark things?

135
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,605
Things that are dark.

136
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,443
- Like what?
- Darkness.

137
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,085
Night.

138
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,362
Things of the night.

139
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,242
Dracula.

140
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,841
You haven't been thinking
about self-harm?

141
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,122
Self-harm, yes. Harm.

142
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,805
Harm of the self.

143
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,969
- Suicide?
- For starters, yes.

144
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,449
Moss, I do not think
that you are suicidal.

145
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,928
What? Why not? I tell you,
I'm at the end of my flipping tether.

146
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,487
Moss! It's not like you
to use that sort of language.

147
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,887
- Flip off!
- Moss!

148
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,527
For God's sake.

149
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,123
- Yes.
- Roy!

150
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,690
I'm sorry, Roy. I may be speaking louder at
the moment because I'm wearing ear plugs.

151
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,646
- Why are you wearing ear plugs?
- That's right!

152
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,810
- What's this contraption?
- Uh... oh... um...

153
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,048
I'm... I'm stealing food
from this machine.

154
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,646
You know I do.

155
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,650
Oh, by the way, Roy,
your work on Project Icarus was very good.

156
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,922
Well done. You did a great job.
Thanks.

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,202
Yeah? I can't hear you.

158
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,408
What's wrong with you?

159
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,091
- Oh, my God. You're crying.
- I'm not crying. You're crying.

160
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,645
What's wrong?

161
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,969
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine. Will you stop
getting at me? You're always getting at me.

162
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,970
I'm not getting at you.
Stop shouting at me.

163
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,051
Why are these things
always so hard to open?

164
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,081
Oh, my God!

165
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,965
Whoa. Calm down, everybody.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,401
What on earth is going on?

167
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,129
I don't know. I feel weird.
I've been swearing like a flipping docker.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,002
Denholm thanked me for Project Icarus

169
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,761
and I started crying like an actress.
What's going on?

170
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,807
- Maybe it's all this stuff that you both eat.
- Oh, will you get off that?

171
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,049
No, honestly, it's true. Moss, what did
you have for breakfast this morning?

172
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,527
- Smarties cereal.
- Oh, my God.

173
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,484
I didn't even know
Smarties made a cereal.

174
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,889
They don't.
It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk.

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,527
Case closed.
It's too much sugar. That's all.

176
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,443
No, no. Hold on, now. I basically live on sugar,
and we've never had these problems before.

177
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,803
Well, the only other explanation is...

178
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,207
- No, no, it's silly.
- What?

179
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,482
Well, I feel ridiculous even saying it,

180
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,447
but, um, where I worked before, it was me
and a few other girls, Liz and Suzanne,

181
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,770
and whenever Aunt Irma was visiting me,

182
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,848
we all kind of...

183
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,161
synchronised.

184
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,170
- What's that got to do with us?
- Well...

185
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,964
- You think...
- Well, maybe.

186
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,048
- You're saying...
- I know it sounds crazy.

187
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,562
Whoa! You don't think
that Aunt Irma's visiting us?

188
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,526
- The symptoms, Roy.
- I am a man! He's a man! We're men!

189
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,291
OK. OK.
Tell me how you're feeling.

190
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,490
I feel delicate.

191
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,845
And, um, annoyed,

192
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,201
and, um...

193
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,288
I think I'm ugly.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,809
That's her.

195
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,482
This is ridiculous. I've never heard
anything so bizarre in my life.

196
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,562
Stop shouting at her! You're always shouting
at her and it's not fair! It's not fair!

197
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,488
- You don't believe this theory, do you?
- No.

198
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,921
No. It's nonsense, isn't it?

199
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,281
She's so silly. Sugar!

200
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,801
Yeah.

201
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,400
- What?
- That's not what's causing it.

202
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,251
- You think it's Irma?
- Yes. Don't you?

203
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,887
No! I'm a man! We're men!

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,244
Well, if it's true, it's the scientific
breakthrough of the afternoon.

205
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,850
- It's not true.
- Don't worry,

206
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,327
I wasn't about to look foolish
by jumping to conclusions,

207
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,683
so I've sent an email out
asking everyone's opinions.

208
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,201
Right. Well, that's a good idea.

209
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,085
No. Sorry.
Could you run that past me again?

210
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
I've sent it to everyone in my
address book. You should have one.

211
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,041
What?

212
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,164
"Do we have PMT?"

213
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,481
You sent this out? Oh, you signed it from
both of us. You signed it from both of us!

214
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,887
Yes. Along with a list of symptoms.

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,085
"Headachy. Weight gain.
Irritability. Anxiety."

216
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,363
- "Breast tenderness"!
- I get that. Don't you?

217
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,088
Yes, but you cannot tell the entire
IT community that we have PMT.

218
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,044
Oh, come on, no one would use
that sort of information against us.

219
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,767
Oh, wait a second.
They would, wouldn't they? Oh, no!

220
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,531
There's probably a whole website
devoted to us already.

221
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,486
- Oh, I only posted it about an hour ago.
- Google our names.

222
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,681
Oh, no!

223
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,449
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

224
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,609
Come on.
It's my turn with the bottle.

225
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,120
God, sorry, Richmond. Sorry.
I always forget you work here.

226
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,960
Yes. I wouldn't normally come out this far,

227
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,964
only, could you have a word
with Moss and Roy?

228
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,731
Ever since they got famous
they've been at each other's throats.

229
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,481
- They're famous?
- Yes. Google their names.

230
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,931
Oh, my goodness.
How many entries do they have?

231
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,045
Thousands. Moss's email's
spreading like a virus.

232
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,686
You've unleashed a monster
with that Aunt Irma business.

233
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,727
Yes, Richmond. Tell me,
how come Aunt Irma isn't affecting you?

234
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,890
Of course it is.
I've been feeling very gloomy all day.

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,367
Not my usual cheery self at all.

236
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,405
Yeah. I guess it's just difficult to tell
underneath all that makeup.

237
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,682
I'm not wearing makeup.

238
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,284
Could you have a word? They're driving
me out of my tiny little mind.

239
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,241
Guys, you're gonna have to... Oh,
my goodness. What happened to your face?

240
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,203
We had an argument.

241
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,882
Have you seen this?
What's happening?

242
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,083
<i>The rioting has been going on all night</i>

243
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,601
<i>The men involved are young, angry,</i>

244
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,406
<i>and almost all of them work with computers.</i>

245
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,481
This is insane.
I mean, what's going on?

246
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,925
<i>In Tokyo, two games designers
went on the rampage in a shopping centre</i>

247
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,202
<i>and frightened a dog.</i>

248
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,281
<i>In Hamburg, a group of software developers
shouted at a bus.</i>

249
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,643
<i>The situation is completely out of contr...</i>

250
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,082
- And it's all because of Aunt Irma.
- But how?

251
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,204
You shouldn't have sent out that email
detailing the symptoms.

252
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,324
You know how suggestible
and easily swayed IT people are.

253
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,408
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

254
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,491
No, you're right. Of course it is.
You shouldn't have sent that email, Moss.

255
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,523
- Don't blame me.
- It's your fault!

256
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,009
Guys. Guys, come on. You're fighting.
It's like you're in a trance.

257
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,091
You're right. We shouldn't be doing this.
This isn't us. We never fight.

258
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,761
- We have to do something.
- Yeah, whatever.

259
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,480
I'm going in.

260
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,762
Dammit, Roy,
I never thought it would come to this.

261
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,885
Well, it has. She's the only one
that's had direct contact with Irma.

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,207
If we can just calm her down, then...

263
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,483
we can hope and pray
that everybody else calms down too.

264
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,365
You've got big balls, Roy.

265
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,928
Thanks.

266
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,963
You're very welcome.

267
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,682
Hiya.

268
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,043
I can never find
a bloody pen in here!

269
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,130
- How's my soldier?
- What do you want?

270
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,925
I just came in for a little chat. Wow!

271
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,441
- You are looking good today.
- Oh. Thank you.

272
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,769
- So slim.
- Yeah, I try and stay in shape, you know.

273
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,089
- Oh, and your hair looks great.
- Yeah. New conditioner.

274
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,441
The action on this <i>is</i> great.

275
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,882
Oh. Hello.

276
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,570
Hello, Maurice. I have to tell you,
I've a little confession to make.

277
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,206
As you may or may not know,
for ethical reasons

278
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,928
I am required not to have any relations
with any of my patients.

279
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,922
But for the last few months,

280
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,805
I've been developing some...

281
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,685
warm feelings towards you.

282
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,961
And the real reason
I terminated your therapy

283
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,845
was so that I could explore

284
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,201
some of these feelings.

285
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,168
I see.

286
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,085
Uh, Jen.

287
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,009
I was just wondering.

288
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,445
When you were working in your old job with
the girls, if things ever got on top of you,

289
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,131
what would you do to...

290
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,170
relax?

291
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,250
Well, we'd have a big girls' night out.

292
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,403
I'd love that, actually.

293
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,003
A big girlie night out.
Fat chance of that round here.

294
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,009
Not necessarily.

295
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,928
Mum?

296
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,251
- This is my psychiatrist.
- Oh, no, no.

297
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,321
I-I'm sorry. It's just that you...
you look exactly like my mother.

298
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,685
Um... no, no, but that... Don't be offended
by that. She's... she's a very sexy woman.

299
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,964
Um, not that... not that
I would want to have sex with her.

300
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,127
Um...

301
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,686
I know that's what you psychiatrists think,

302
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,885
but, um, I swear to God
that there's nothing to it in my case.

303
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,723
Um... you know, my mother wouldn't stand
for any of that kind of nonsense.

304
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,764
I-I can just hear her now.

305
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,089
"What are you doing, Roy?
What are you doing?"

306
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,731
You handled that well.

307
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,244
- That's the psychiatrist.
- Yes. I, uh... I think she's my girlfriend now.

308
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,967
Whoa! No, Moss, listen to me.
You can never see that woman again.

309
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,402
- She looks exactly like my mother.
- Oh, stop it, you're exaggerating.

310
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,842
- She's the spit of her.
- Oh, come on. What went on in there?

311
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,042
Right. OK. Um...

312
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,449
What would you say
to a big girls' night out?

313
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,962
How big are the girls?

314
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,451
I can't believe
I'd never seen <i>Steel Magnolias.</i>

315
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,971
Oh, my God, it's good, isn't it?

316
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,526
- I know what we can watch next.
- Yeah!

317
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,526
- You really liked that film?
- Yes. Didn't you?

318
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,881
No! It was heart-warming.

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,406
Well, I feel like a princess, Roy.
And don't tell me you don't feel the same.

320
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,603
Well, my breast tenderness has gone.

321
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,361
No! What am I talking about? I'm a man.
We're men! It's the worst night of my life.

322
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,845
Hiya.

323
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,564
OK.

324
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,968
<i>Beaches</i> or <i>Dirty Dancing!</i>

325
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,084
Oh, <i>Beaches.</i> No, <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>
Oh, I can't decide.

326
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,331
Dear God! Dear God!
I don't know which one to watch either! Oh!

327
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,522
- Do you know what we should do?
- What?

328
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,881
Something else. Um...

329
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,925
Ooh, I know.
Why don't we go to the thank-you party?

330
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,690
But I thought you didn't want to go.

331
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,045
Well, you know, everybody else is there, and
they did nothing, and we did all the work.

332
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,369
- Yeah. Screw them.
- Yeah. Screw them.

333
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,891
- OK. Come on. Let's go, girls.
- Yeah!

334
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,766
- OK, but first ten minutes of <i>Beaches.</i>
- Yeah.

335
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,208
Rattle those chains!

336
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,691
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

337
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,725
Oh, yes. I should just say
I asked Dr Mendall to join us.

338
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,807
What?

339
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,321
Moss! Over here!

340
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,925
What's wrong with you?

341
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,009
Nothing. I just...
I really need to get drunk.

342
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,487
Yeah, I'd like to get drunk.

343
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,605
- We should get drunk together, then.
- OK, yeah.

344
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,964
We should get so drunk
that we don't know what's going on.

345
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,889
All right.

346
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,844
And turn round,

347
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,884
four dead cyclists, all my fault.

348
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,922
- Brilliant. The same thing happened...
- IT guys. Gangway.

349
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,609
<i>♪</i> Everybody

350
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,688
<i>♪</i> Crazy

351
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,087
Oh, dear.

352
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,691
Oh, my God. I didn't.

353
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,051
I didn't.

354
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,725
Good morning.

355
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,765
- I've made you a cup of tea.
- Oh, thanks, Mum.

356
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,690
Mum? That's interesting.

357
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,810
