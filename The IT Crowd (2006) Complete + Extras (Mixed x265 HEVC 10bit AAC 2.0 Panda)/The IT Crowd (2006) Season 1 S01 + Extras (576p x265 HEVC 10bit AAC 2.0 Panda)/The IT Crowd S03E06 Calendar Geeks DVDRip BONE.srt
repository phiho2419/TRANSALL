1
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,442
- Have you nearly finished, Roy?
- Yep.

2
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,087
- You're taking a very long time.
- It's a very complicated problem.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,762
You've got a lot of... chabaranks
in your hard drive. I'll get them out eventually.

4
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,406
Urh! Frustrating!

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,127
Come on, work!
Work, you bloody computer!

6
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,961
- Nadine, do you know about digital cameras?
- Oh, Roy might.

7
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,721
I do, as it happens.
I'm an amateur photographer, actually.

8
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,050
I just got this new one,
but it's really complicated.

9
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,685
That's fixed.

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,690
- What was wrong with it?
- Wasn't turned on.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,767
Oh...

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,202
I don't even know why I got rid
of my old one - it was working fine.

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,130
Well, these all look good.

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,686
What's going on with this fella?!

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,681
Look at him! He's pulling a mad face!
He looks completely mental.

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,886
That's Dave, my brother.
He's got a very serious condition.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,769
When I said "mental" there,
I meant mental in the sense of... intelligent.

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,247
You know, like he's a big reader.

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,648
- He has boss-eyedness.
- Bossiednis?

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,171
He's permanently boss-eyed.

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,040
That must be a big pain in the arse.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,722
It is. And the terrible thing is, people think
there's actually something funny about this.

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,323
No! Who could think
there's something funny about this?

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,371
But it's a proper condition
and he really suffers, he really...

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,525
Oh, hey...

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,689
I'd just give anything
if Dave could have a normal life.

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,327
- Oh, hey now...
- Kimberly, are you OK?

28
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,329
It's just... Dave.

29
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,761
Oh, poor Dave.

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,524
Hey, I've got a great idea.

31
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,928
Why don't we do something
to raise money for people like Dave?

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,647
You know, like... We must be able
to think of something... Like a fun run!

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,604
- That's a good idea.
- Or a nude calendar.

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,609
Yes!

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,122
I would say that's maybe even a better idea
than the fun-run idea.

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,608
We could call it "The girls of the 7th floor".

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,243
Yes!

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,924
- It's a very strong theme.
- Roy could be the photographer!

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,602
I could do the photographs. Because
I said I was an amateur photographer.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,849
Let's do a brainstorm.
I'd like to be November, if that's OK.

41
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,724
- Can I be April?
- Yes.

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,731
In October we've got to have
a Halloween theme...

43
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,206
Boss-eyedness is something
which affects 1% of Britons.

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,487
It doesn't impair eyesight, yet people with
boss-eye are routinely discriminated against.

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,400
Just like any. form of discrimination,
it should be stopped

46
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,205
But we can only do so with your help.

47
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,800
That's right - we're looking at you.

48
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,361
It's not funny, Jen.

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,690
- It's a very serious condition.
- I know it is. I know it is. I'm sorry.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,089
Look, this is exactly the kind of discrimination
we are fighting against.

51
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,410
- And what do you need from me?
- I just need a little time off work.

52
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,331
We're trying to raise money
for the boss-eyed.

53
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,890
- Who? Who is?
- Just me and some people.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,081
Oh, yeah? Who?

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,601
People from upstairs.
You wouldn't know them.

56
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,768
- Oh, OK. What are you gonna do?
- Well...

57
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,484
- Hi.
- Hi.

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,444
- Hiya.
- What are you talking about?

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,043
Er, nothing. I'm just talking to Jen
about a private project.

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,730
What is it?

61
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,482
It's just a private project I'm doing
that's private.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,570
What is it?

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,720
It's just a thing. It's just a big bloody
pain-in-the-arse thing that I might do.

64
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,968
Oh, you are being modest.

65
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,085
It's a very kind thing you're doing,
very generous, very charitable.

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,168
I really am impressed.
Good for you.

67
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,087
What's he done, persuaded all the girls
on seven to do a nude calendar for charity?!

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,962
- Bye.
- Bye, Moss.

69
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,644
- Oh, God, he's right.
- Oh, no... How the hell... No, no... Aww!

70
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,401
- He made it sound sleazy!
- It is sleazy!

71
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,761
Oh, what kind of man
would want to photograph

72
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,724
a bunch of beautiful women
without any clothes on, Roy?

73
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,322
The kind of man
who wants to help people, Jen!

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,809
- No, I don't like it. I find it very offensive.
- No, it's going to be tasteful.

75
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,649
No, it's not.

76
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,004
You're right, it's not. It's not.
It's going to be rude. It's going to be sexy.

77
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,602
All the things men like.
And it'll make a million quid for that charity.

78
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,166
- No, no, no, no. Absolutely not.
- Why not?

79
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,684
Taking your clothes off... If it's unemployed
men or old ladies from Yorkshire, it's fun.

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,681
If it's sexy women, it's oppression.
No, I will not give you any time off for this.

81
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,009
Well, OK. Then I will do it in my own time.

82
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,567
- Roy, you're behaving like a horny teenager.
- No, you are.

83
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,366
- For God's sake, try and have some dignity.
- No, I won't. I won't.

84
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,970
- Sit down.
- No.

85
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,527
- Try and have an adult conversation.
- I'm doing it. It's for charity.

86
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,768
And there's nothing you can do about it!

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,928
You're embarrassing yourself!

88
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,122
Roy, stop it! Come back here!

89
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,766
Roy, don't be silly, come back!
Roy!

90
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,129
- I'm really pleased we've had this talk.
- Thanks for seeing us.

91
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,847
- Any advice you need about anything...
- Oh, you're so lovely.

92
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,007
Hiya.

93
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,286
Roy, thank God you're here. Jen's been telling
us how the calendar would've been sexist...

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,526
Oh, has she?

95
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,803
How it'd be much better
if we used old ladies or unemployed men.

96
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,161
Ohhh, good.

97
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,251
She thinks we'll make a lot more money
because of the "ah" factor.

98
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,486
The "ah" factor?

99
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,446
The thing that makes you go, "Ah"
when you hear about it.

100
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,005
Oh, yeah...

101
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,331
But will anyone actually want to see old
women or destitute men with no clothes on?

102
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,525
Won't that just make people go, "Agh!",
rather than "Ah"?

103
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,804
Guys, I've got a great idea. Why don't we
all ask our grans to do the calendar?

104
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,366
- Aaarrghh!
- That is a great idea!

105
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,123
Oh, Nadine, you are so full of ideas.
But can I... Hold on one second.

106
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,486
What's our theme? Isn't our theme "Girls of
the 7th floor"? That was a very strong theme.

107
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,764
Yes, Roy, but now the theme
can be "Grans of the girls of the 7th floor".

108
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,168
Oh, yeah...
I don't want to take photos of grannies.

109
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,127
This could do very well, Roy. This could be
tasteful. Like the one Helen Mirren did.

110
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,926
Old ladies, pot plants covering their bits -
you know the sort of thing.

111
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,567
An erotic calendar
the whole family could enjoy.

112
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,923
Roy, you can't drop out now.
Douglas has paid for the studio time.

113
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,601
- What? Has he?
- Yeah. He's very interested in this project.

114
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,328
And I just have to say how I'm finding
this whole thing just... so moving,

115
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,490
how so many men have shown interest
and support for the calendar.

116
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,889
I mean, people really do care
about the boss-eyeds.

117
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,607
Roy... you can't drop out now.

118
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,211
I wasn't... wrong about you, was I, Roy?

119
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,881
I thought you were special.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,082
I am.

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,170
I'm so special. I... No... I...

122
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,921
Let's do it!
Let's go round up those grans!

123
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,647
Thank you! Oh, thank you!

124
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,649
That's OK.

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,043
- Hi.
- Hi!

126
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,970
You know,
we could just get a proper photographer.

127
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,321
- Oh, no, I'm happy to do it.
- OK.

128
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,523
- How's it going?
- Not a great start, I have to say.

129
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,283
Of all the girls on seven,
only nine have grans that are still alive.

130
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:56,170
Of that nine, one is having a...
hip replacement on the day of the shoot,

131
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,128
one is a little... senile
and may not know what's happening...

132
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,326
and the last one...
the last one has a gangrenous arm.

133
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,482
But she still wants to do it.

134
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,162
So all I have to do now is hit the streets
and find six old women that I've never met

135
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,365
who'd be happy to take all their clothes off
and let me take photographs of them.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,729
Why are you doing this?

137
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,050
Same reason I do everything, Jen -
to have sex with a lady.

138
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,003
Ah...

139
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,529
What?

140
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,611
I said,
"Do you want to be in a nude calendar?"

141
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,484
- Do I want a calendar?
- No, no. No.

142
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,251
Do you... want...

143
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,884
to do...

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,889
a nude calendar?

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,002
- For charity.
- Oh, for charity!

146
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,647
Oh, well, in that case, yes, I'll take it.
How much is it?

147
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
No, no, no. No, no. No.

148
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,842
Do you want to do a calendar?

149
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,169
But the doctor's already changed my catheter.

150
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,681
No, no... No.

151
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,450
I need you... to take all your clothes off...
and have me take photographs of you.

152
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,849
Oh, you remembered your old mum's birthday.

153
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,283
IT?

154
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,643
Jen, hi.
I just wanted you to know

155
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,606
if this calendar doesn't make a million,
I'm holding you responsible.

156
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,688
What?! That's not very fair.

157
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,566
I'm sad to say that the only secure route
to a knighthood in this sorry age

158
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,489
is via charity work.

159
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,727
You can't do that. It wasn't my idea.

160
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,322
Nonetheless.
The idea came from your department,

161
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,649
and as head of the department
it's your nuts on the block.

162
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,684
- Oh, Mr Reynholm...
- Don't worry, Jen.

163
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,009
Just make it as sexy as hell
and watch the money pour in.

164
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,761
Sexy, sexy, sexy.
Every page sexier than the last.

165
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,486
Mr Reynholm...

166
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,887
Oh, grans... Grans aren't sexy.
That's not gonna make any money.

167
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,246
What kind of society are we living in?!

168
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,527
- What?
- Apparently we live in the kind of society

169
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,441
that sees a man who just wants
to take naked photos of some old ladies

170
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,688
as some sort of weirdo!

171
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,484
Who deserves to be chased and shouted at
and beaten... and chased...

172
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,929
- Did you tell them it's for the boss-eyeds?
- Oh, I did, I did.

173
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,965
I did tell them that, Jen, and you know what?
They just laughed at me.

174
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,047
What?

175
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,484
They just laughed at me, Jen.
They don't care about the boss-eyeds.

176
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,447
Wait, Roy. You know what? Maybe
we should rethink the theme a little bit.

177
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,531
"Grans of the girls of the 7th floor" -
it's such a mouthful.

178
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,928
Why don't we just bring it back
to "Girls of the 7th floor"?

179
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,761
- You said it was sexist.
- Oh, ppfftt! It's empowering!

180
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,930
- Sexist! How dare you be so patronising?
- Oh, you... Whoa-whoa-whoa...

181
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,728
And you'd enjoy it, Roy. Yeah, you'd love
to take those photos, wouldn't you?

182
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,640
You'd enjoy taking those photos.
I bet you would. You'd enjoy that a lot more.

183
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,004
D'you know what I'm talking about?
Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?

184
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,770
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on!

185
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,884
No, no. I don't think Kimberly would like it.

186
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,482
And I don't want to make any wrong moves.
I cannot blow this one.

187
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,288
Kimberly is the best thing that ever happened
to me, and she hasn't happened to me yet.

188
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,200
We are not gonna make any money
with grannies.

189
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,402
I'm back!

190
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,846
- What? What do you mean?
- I'm back. From holiday.

191
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,888
- You were on holiday?
- Yes, I was on holiday.

192
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,481
- Oh, that's right...
- Yes, yes, yes...

193
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,764
- You didn't know I was on holiday?
- No, no, no, we did. Where did you go?

194
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,089
You didn't know I was on holiday!

195
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,048
Oh, we did, we did... We missed you.

196
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,889
I've been gone a week!

197
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,241
- A week?!
- Wow!

198
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,089
- Hm...
- What?

199
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,567
- You know what's very in at the moment?
- I don't.

200
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,763
Geeks. You lot.

201
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,327
The whole nerd thing.
Geek chic. It's very in.

202
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,169
So?

203
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,286
So it's a calendar
that celebrates scientific achievement?

204
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,970
- That's right.
- About time!

205
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,290
Think of it as an opportunity
to re-enact all of your favourite moments

206
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,926
from the history of science.

207
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,089
And maths?

208
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,282
- And maths.
- Yes!

209
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,007
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

210
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,009
- Yep?
- OK, are they all there?

211
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,249
- Yep.
- You rounded up your best-looking friends?

212
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,804
Yep.

213
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,811
OK, great, Roy. Remember, it's gotta be sexy.
Sexy, sexy, sexy.

214
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,330
Yep.

215
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,649
OK, so...
if the rest of you want to take lunch...

216
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,201
I'll do Moss first.

217
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,806
Laters.

218
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,847
So I'll hold up the beaker
like, "Ah! I've discovered something."

219
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,770
- Exactly. Yes.
- But what have I discovered?

220
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,248
- It doesn't matter.
- I think it does a bit, actually.

221
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,486
Um, OK, you have discovered... nuclear bombs.

222
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,049
In a beaker?

223
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,484
You're right. It's surprising.
So give me "surprised".

224
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,244
Yeah! That's it.

225
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,681
And it's confusing.

226
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,003
Yes. You're "confused".

227
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,728
And you are afraid of the consequences...
Give me fear! Fear!

228
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,241
Yeah. That's good. That's good.

229
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,362
OK, nice, nice.

230
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,327
And... if... if you're hot or anything, Moss,

231
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,206
maybe you could undo
some buttons on your shirt.

232
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,322
No, I'm all right, thanks, Roy.

233
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,245
Maybe just undo your top button.

234
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,725
Why?

235
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,368
It's hot. It's a hot lab.
Because of all the... fusion.

236
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,767
- Fission!
- Fission. Yeah.

237
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,250
That's it.

238
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,441
Maybe just one more button.

239
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,687
OK. That's good.

240
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,240
And maybe you could, er...
maybe you could get down on all fours.

241
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,366
Why?

242
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,046
Because you had some microscopic
nuclear things and you dropped them.

243
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,606
- Oh, did I? Oh...
- Big klutz!

244
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,008
- Oh, nightmare! Oh...
- They're down there somewhere.

245
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,284
- It's a pain. Oh, where are they?
- Yeah... And you're getting angry.

246
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,131
- Well, I would. It's frustrating.
- Because you can't find them.

247
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,924
- Arhhh...
- Arrhh! Grrr!

248
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,202
You know how you growl
if you can't find stuff.

249
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,243
- Grrr!
- That's it.

250
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,842
And there are other people in the lab
and they're being so noisy.

251
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,405
OK. Shh!

252
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,363
- That's it.
- Shh!

253
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,168
- Bit less of...
- Yes.

254
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,328
And... and then it occurs to you

255
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,240
that maybe you put your microscopic
nuclear things in your back pocket.

256
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,091
Oh, did I? Oh...

257
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,561
That's a pain. Why would they be there?
And yet I've put them there.

258
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,682
- Yeah.
- It's strange.

259
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,767
Yeah...

260
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,850
- You're working hard. You're tired.
- Well, I've been busy.

261
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,966
- Oh, they're being noisy again. Shush them.
- Shh! Shh! Shh!

262
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,209
- That's good, Moss. Yeah...
- Shh!

263
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,845
OK, so just give me a cheeky
sort of "I've been a naughty boy" look.

264
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,241
But I've just solved Fermat's Theorem.

265
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,762
Yes, but... you solved it in a way

266
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,805
that the stuffed shirts of the time
would've found very naughty.

267
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:17,644
Am I Fermat?
Because if I am, these clothes are wrong.

268
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,610
Yeah... You're more...
You're a naughty mathematician.

269
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,760
Roy, you're doing it wrong.
The lighting is all wrong.

270
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,408
The pictures are gonna be very gloomy, Roy.
This whole set-up is inadequate.

271
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,927
It's a celebration.
You've just discovered penicillin.

272
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,126
But why are our tops off?

273
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,963
I always take my top off when I'm celebrating.
Don't you?

274
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,441
Oh, yeah, I suppose so. Yeah, of course.

275
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,451
OK... Cavort!

276
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,170
That's it.

277
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,888
Yeah!

278
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,523
Thank God for all that penicillin.

279
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,122
Touch each other in a celebratory way.

280
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,531
Yeah! That's it.

281
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,847
Yeah... Yes...

282
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,444
That's good.

283
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,290
That's it. Ruffle your hair.

284
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,607
That's good. OK. Nice, nice.

285
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,804
That's it. Look over like that...

286
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,602
You... pick him up, like a wheelbarrow,

287
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,009
and you walk with him,
and then you come in this way. OK?

288
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,683
Like any. form of discrimination,
it should be stopped

289
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,121
But we can only do so with your help.

290
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,244
That's right - we're looking atyou.

291
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,608
Thank you.
I just wanted to say a few words.

292
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,041
Hey, come on. We did it.

293
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,128
This is exciting, isn't it? Reynholm Industries'
first sexy new charity calendar.

294
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,687
Come on, goofy! We wanna see the calendar!

295
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,285
I can't wait. I hereby announce that
speech over and the calendar ready to go.

296
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,560
And I think I speak for all men here
when I say I can't wait to get that box open

297
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,162
and feast my eyes upon its sexy contents!

298
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,768
Whoa! Someone's played an awful prank.

299
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,804
There's nothing here
but gloomy pictures of morons.

300
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,244
No, not morons. Geeks.
They're sexy now - you know, geek chic.

301
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,206
Geek chic? I wanna tear my eyes out!

302
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,766
This is horrible! Horrible!

303
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,644
- This is your fault.
- It was Roy's idea.

304
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,482
You idiot! I wouldn't buy this
and it's in aid of me!

305
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,841
- I didn't do it.
- I'm talking to her!

306
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,645
It's hard to tell with your mad eyes.

307
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,089
- Sorry we're late.
- Oh, here are the calendars! Brilliant!

308
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, great! We're on a calendar.
Box-fresh!

309
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,330
There goes the entire audience
for our calendar.

310
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,722
And they got it for free.

311
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,610
Roy, I don't care
that no one liked the calendar.

312
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,770
That was... the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me.

313
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,247
- Really?
- Really.

314
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,085
The doctor's already changed my catheter.

315
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,167
Roy? What's wrong?

316
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,248
Uh... Nothing.

317
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,082
Er, no, I...
Don't let me stop the kissing. Let's...

318
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,446
Shhh...

319
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,005
Nnah!

320
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,128
- Oh, no...
- Roy, are you OK?

321
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,846
Mm. I'm just tired.

322
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,442
Let's... Oh...

323
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,206
Cavort!

324
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,448
- You're doing it wrong.
