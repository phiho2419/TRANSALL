00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,604
What is Friendface? Friendface
is a great new site for meeting people.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,681
How does it work? Friendface works along the
same principle as a cold or a terrible plague,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,600
but it's not disgusting germs
that Friendface spreads, it's friendship.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,566
Each Friendface page is like a Petri dish
filled with friendship germs.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,284
When you stickyour face in,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,166
you may come away with millions of people
attached to your face!

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,568
That's right, it's basically
a diseased face of friendship!

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,969
Just sign up with Friendface
by giving us all of your personal information,

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,051
and we'll provide a web page where you can
meet new friends, catch up with old ones,

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,288
and maybe find that special someone.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,131
Don't think about germs now -
that analogy's over.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,926
Now it's just love and companionship,
and everything's fine.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,965
We own everything you put on Friendface -
it says so in the terms and agreements.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,402
But don't worry, we won't use it
to do anything bad, we promise.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,161
Just think about love and companionship
and everything's fine.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,170
- Friendface. Friendface.
-  Friendface.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,885
Can you two not use my email address
any more, please? I've got a new one.

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,605
Jennywenny@Friendface? Oh, you've not
signed up with Friendface, have you?

19
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,007
Yes, I have, actually.
Why not? It's great.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,771
I joined last night
and I've already got 30 friends.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,569
Baaaa! Yes, let's alljoin Friendface
and become part of the herd! I don't think so.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,762
Why not? They're terrific!

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,123
You can catch up on old friends,
you can flirt with people...

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,531
I've got better things to do than to talk
to friends and flirt with people, thank you.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,211
You can play Scrabble online with it...

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,609
It's just another way of shoving advertising
in your face. You'll regret it.

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,441
It might be a great way to meet women.
All the girls on 7 are on it.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,483
- I'm in!
- What?

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,887
- I've joined.
- That was quick!

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,129
It was what you said about Scrabble.
I'm in a game now.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,241
- I'm in!
- What?

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,522
- I've joined!
- What about the advertising?

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,042
Oh, advertising doesn't have any effect on me,
Jen. I tune it out.

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,925
- So, the girls on 7, Kimberley, she's on this?
- Uh-huh.

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,726
Oh, cool, look! They've got
this great little game on their home page.

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,287
You have to throw a little can of cola
into a giant mouth.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,609
That's brilliant.
God, I'm so thirsty.

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,041
I've got to have a word with you...

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,084
- Hang on.
- You know, you can change your settings

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,249
so you don't get that annoying bleep
with every message.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,840
Incoming message!

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,489
Sorry, that's me.

43
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,883
I just have to tell you...

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,570
Oh, hang on.

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,728
Open a chat window
and we can talk in it.

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,687
- How do I do that?
- Press the speech bubble in the left corner.

47
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,927
Yes!

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,691
Oh, yeah, but don't forget, if...

49
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,886
- What are you like?!
- If I might interject.

50
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,522
- That's hilarious!
- Oh, Moss!

51
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,450
That was a classic Moss line.

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,006
I love this.
I feel so social.

53
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,288
Jen, I'm going home now.
It's nearly 7:30.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,041
Just answering all my messages.
They piled up while we were chatting.

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,403
So many people I don't care about
getting back in touch.

56
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,651
Oh, there's another one. And I'm getting into
online games - you know, real brain-teasers.

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,128
And I'm filling out a form
on how much I love Cuke. Have you tried it?

58
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,404
Cuke? Yeah! I love Cuke.
It's heaven in a can.

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,250
Anyway, I'm going to head, all right?
Jen, don't get too obsessed by that.

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,806
No, I won't. Bye, Moss.

61
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,486
Oh, someone's added me as their friend.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,001
I went to school with her.
Wonder how she's doing?

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,804
Oh, not very well. That's good.

64
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,081
- Incoming message!
- Jesus Christ!

65
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,487
I mean, Jesus Christ?

66
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,241
Oh, God. Oh God, oh God, oh God. Oh, God!

67
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,284
Excuse me, some of us
are trying to sleep round here.

68
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,882
This woman that I went out with once
wants to meet up again.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,607
I thought I'd got rid of her,
but, oh no, she found me on Friendface.

70
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,725
Now I'll have to spend all afternoon
making up lies to get rid of her again.

71
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,129
Oh, I think that is very mean.
If it were me, I would like to know the truth.

72
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,006
- That you wear way too much makeup?
- I do not!

73
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,567
That's a horrible thing to say!
How dare you!

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,444
Not you, Jen. This girl.

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,370
- Oh, does she?
- Big time.

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,443
- Did you sleep with her?
- No.

77
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,361
It wasn't my fault! I got really drunk
to try and make the evening pass quicker,

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,086
then by the end of it
the makeup started to work for me.

79
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,361
Oh, please!

80
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,883
I'm not proud of it. It's not going on my CV.
But every man has a story like this.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,210
- This is not your first story like this.
- Every man has a few stories like this.

82
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,166
Oh, no, it's all coming back to me now.
She used to slap it on with a trowel.

83
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,683
God, why don't women have the confidence
to know that less is more?

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,044
Then, when she started crying
it all ran down her face.

85
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,164
It was like breaking up with the Joker.

86
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,329
Hang on - she was that upset,
she was crying?

87
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,206
- What? No...
- It sounds like you really hurt her feelings.

88
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,403
The least you can do is tell her the truth.
Be a man, for God's sake.

89
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,764
Whoa, don't... Hey, I am a man.
I will tell her. I will email her.

90
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,963
- No, you have to tell her face to face.
- The hell I do.

91
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,970
This is a fragile young woman.
What if she reacts badly?

92
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,082
That's why I'm doing it on email.

93
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,000
No, you have to tell her the truth
and you have to do it face to face.

94
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,326
Do I?

95
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,886
My mum's on Friendface! My mum!

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,651
I have another channel of communication
with my mum!

97
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,206
- Isn't that good?
- No, it is not good.

98
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,290
She's put down
her current mood as "sensual".

99
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,842
Why did you accept her as a friend?

100
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,010
What are you, an animal? I can't turn down
a friend request from my mum.

101
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,408
- Message for me.
- Oh...

102
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,410
I am eating my apple, Mum!

103
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,801
She packed me an apple this morning
and it's the issue of the day.

104
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,844
I have to go.
I'm meeting an old school friend for lunch.

105
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,487
Isn't it great the way Friendface
brings people together?

106
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,688
Nanny's chasing the dog,
the kids are screaming, absolute bedlam,

107
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,044
and here's me running out of the house to go
to a meeting with the major shareholders.

108
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,643
- My life is an absolute nightmare.
- Yes... Yes, mine too.

109
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,801
So, the other girls,
what are they doing?

110
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,605
Elaine is head of marketing
at Dennis Publishing.

111
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,326
- She's married to the editor of Esquire.
- Is she?

112
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,205
Veronica's an A and R with Arista.

113
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,688
Her big embarrassing story
is she passed on Arctic Monkeys.

114
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,006
Idiot.

115
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,886
Jilly is an architect,
designing a new wing on the Tate.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,289
Jilly? Jilly Spencer?
She used to eat the wood on her desk.

117
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,051
- I always thought she was slow.
- No, she's a genius.

118
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,846
- Wow. Everybody's doing great.
- Yeah.

119
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,567
So, what about you, Jen?
What are you up to?

120
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,331
- What am I up to?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,001
- Oh, God, I hope that's not a rude question.
- No, no, no, no.

122
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,090
It'd be awful
if I just listed all our successful friends

123
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,602
and you were stuck
in some terrible, dead-end job you hated.

124
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,569
God, yeah, that would be an absolute fucker.
No, no, I'm head of IT at Reynholm Industries.

125
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,207
Ohh! I didn't know
you were interested in computers.

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,005
"Interested" is not the word.

127
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,771
Sorry.

128
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,921
Hi, babe.

129
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,121
- You didn't have to calljust to tell me that.
- Aw.

130
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,562
No! I can't, I'm in public.

131
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,885
Stop it!

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,571
Yeah, of course I'm wearing them.

133
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,807
I'll have another one, please.

134
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,040
- Hi, Roy.
- Hiya.

135
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,243
Roy, do you have any...

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,243
attractive, successful-looking friends?

137
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,964
No!

138
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,206
- What, none at all?
- No.

139
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,762
Oh, God.
Well, maybe you could help me, then.

140
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,963
Wow. That's flattering.
Are you pissed?

141
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,650
A little bit.

142
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,367
Could you come to a school reunion with me
and pretend you're my husband?

143
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,644
Do you really think you can quiz me
for a better option and think I'll still say yes?

144
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,845
- I'll give you £50.
- When is it?

145
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,329
Tomorrow night.
I sort of bigged myself up to this girl.

146
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,684
She never had much time for me and
I wanted to impress her, so I need a husband.

147
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,170
Yeah, I can't, because tomorrow night
I'm spending the evening with the Joker.

148
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,365
I'm going to do what you said -
tell her I'm just not interested in her.

149
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,563
Ooh, you're not actually
going to do that face to face?

150
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,766
- You told me to!
- Well, aren't you worried she'll go mad?

151
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,488
I'm very worried about that!

152
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,047
Oh, you...
Oh, you are a f... Oh...!

153
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,403
- I'm going to cancel.
- No, no, you can't cancel, not now.

154
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,362
- Who am I going to ask, then?
- Who are you going to ask what?

155
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,927
Nothing.

156
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,285
The queen of honesty here needs
a pretend husband for her school reunion.

157
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,561
When is it?

158
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,563
- So, you remember what to do?
- Big you up to the max.

159
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,047
- By?
- Listing your fictional achievements.

160
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,241
Uh-huh. And?

161
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,287
Saying how lucky I am to have met you
and talking about our sweet sex life.

162
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,085
Maybe not the last one.
We don't want to sound too smug.

163
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,047
Hey, if I'm pretending to be married,
I'm pretending to be sexually active.

164
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,886
Don't worry, Jen, I plan on earning this £10.

165
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,489
Five now, five later. OK.

166
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,528
And I will have a Bacardi and Cuke.
Thank you.

167
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,520
So, how are you?

168
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,608
I'm fine.

169
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,283
It was great seeing your profile
pop up on Friendface -

170
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,210
gave me a great excuse to get back in touch.

171
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,769
Yeah... That's the brilliant thing
about that bloody website.

172
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,769
- And how are you?
- I'm great. I am great.

173
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,726
Yeah, I'm glad that we got together,
Alison, because, erm...

174
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,083
It's only fair that I be
completely honest with you. The truth is...

175
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,568
- Do you mind if I say something first?
- Er, OK.

176
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,369
I've never been very good with words,
so I wrote it down and it turned into a poem.

177
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,123
I'm sorry, are you going to read a poem now?
Is that what's actually going to happen?

178
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,881
- Yeah, is that all right?
- Wouldn't you prefer to text it to me?

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,241
It's a bit long for that.

180
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,169
Okey-dokey.

181
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,567
"Oh, gentle Irish eyes...

182
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,402
"..tousled brown hair...

183
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,488
smile as big as my favourite teddy bear."

184
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,321
That's a bit corny -
I might take it out or I might leave it in.

185
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,331
"Without you... I am just a husk."

186
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,283
Er... erm... A husk?

187
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,244
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

188
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,006
"Without you, I am just a husk,
A dead thing.

189
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,411
My new best friend is a razor, a rope,
A noose to swing... in.

190
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,649
Without you, the sweet release of death
Would be all that could give me hope.

191
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,929
When I see your face on my computer...

192
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,808
I don't just see you...

193
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,767
I see our future."

194
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,251
Oh, it's, er... Ohhhhh...

195
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,691
...which is how my sexy wife became the first
ginger woman on the cover of Newsweek.

196
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,529
That is wow!

197
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,043
Just when I think I've heard every story that
puts Jen in a good light, you have another.

198
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,528
Yes, and they're beginning to sound
a little bit unbelievable.

199
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,645
Oh, I can't help it.
I love this well-travelled high-earner.

200
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,766
A woman in the living room, a chef
in the kitchen, a prostitute in the bedroom.

201
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,363
Ow!

202
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,600
Jen, why don't you tell them all
about your bionic arm?

203
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,603
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could do.
Or... or we could talk about something else.

204
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,485
Yeah, we've heard enough stories about Jen.

205
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,171
We want to hear about the guy
that tamed her heart.

206
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,282
Yeah. What do you do, Moss?

207
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,529
I'm a professional tennis player.

208
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,406
He doesn't like
talking about it, though, so...

209
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,249
I do.

210
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,761
- Where do you play?
- Where don't I play!

211
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,690
- Wimbledon?
- I don't play there.

212
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,727
- Are you seeded, Moss?
- Bit of a personal question, Terry.

213
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,290
But, yes, I'm highly seeded. We have
two lovely children, Zenith and Quasar.

214
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,051
I... I love... I love this song.

215
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,846
Let's all stop talking
and dance to this song.

216
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,685
Come on. Let's dance!

217
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,965
Her name is Jen.
Er, she's a work colleague.

218
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,166
We've been seeing each other for some time.

219
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,521
I love her. I love that woman.

220
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,925
- Do you have a picture of her?
- A picture of her? No.

221
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,202
What, not even on your phone?

222
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,962
No. It never occurred to me to take a picture
of her because I see her all the time.

223
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,447
You just don't want me!

224
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,283
I do, I do... It's... Why wouldn't I want you?
No, it's just... it's this girl.

225
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,725
- There is no girl.
- There is! It's a real girl.

226
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,968
Look, could you just stop crying?

227
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,926
No. I'm never going to stop crying!

228
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,691
Do you want to meet her?
We can meet her.

229
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,725
- What, really?
- Yeah, let's go and meet Jen.

230
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,764
Will that make you a little less mad?

231
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,724
Tough, though,
the whole marriage thing.

232
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,483
Terry, it's as tough as a cow's back.
But you know what takes the edge off for me?

233
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,050
Regular, uninhibited, exploratory sex
with a partner who's even wilder than I am.

234
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,482
Yup, that's Jen.
She may look like a ginger angel,

235
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,491
but get her behind closed doors
and she turns into Peter Stringfellow.

236
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,130
God, I envy you. These days
Delina hardly ever lets me, you know, do it.

237
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,403
Ah, I'm on Jen at least four times a day.

238
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,607
As I've already said,
I am fully seeded.

239
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,327
- You've got it really sorted out, haven't you?
- Yeah. It's very surprising, isn't it?

240
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,761
No of fence, Jen, but I've got to admit

241
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,522
I always thought you'd be the one
whose life just went completely off the rails.

242
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,690
You always seemed to attract such chaos
at school, but look at you now.

243
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,371
Delina, can we be best friends?

244
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,965
To tell you the truth, I think Delina
might be sleeping with someone else.

245
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,569
No, she's just over there.

246
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,490
- I mean, this is just between ourselves.
- Of course.

247
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,401
There are little clues here and there,
things only a husband would pick up.

248
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,683
Like, someone wrote a message
on her Friendface wall,

249
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,646
"Can't wait
to shag your arse off again soon."

250
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,446
I don't know,
maybe I'm reading too much into it.

251
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,487
Still, if I ever found out
who that person was...

252
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,083
Agh! It's a pickle, Terry. Awh!
Women! Agh!

253
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,809
If I had a pound
for every bloody woman... Arh!

254
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,446
I hear ya.

255
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,489
- Hi there, Jen.
- What are you doing here?

256
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,888
I saw on your profile
that you were having a party.

257
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,446
That's the great thing about Friendface -

258
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,361
I get to see what all my employees are doing,
all the time.

259
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,566
Come on, be game.

260
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,921
Ah, there she is. There's Jen!

261
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,044
Jen, I will help you out,
but I need you to play along with me.

262
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,528
This is Alison.

263
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,688
She's that friend I told you about.

264
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,691
And this, this is Jen,
the woman I love.

265
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,048
What's going on here?

266
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,563
- What are you doing here?
- Enjoying an evening out with my woman.

267
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,444
What?

268
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,401
Jen, who is this joker?

269
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,682
No of fence.

270
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,283
OK, what the hell is going on here?

271
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,244
Moss is my husband, Roy.

272
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,251
But you said you wanted me.
She really did.

273
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,291
It's true, I did want you. At one point
you were the one that I wanted.

274
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,449
But then you left. You left, Roy.

275
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,804
And so I turned to Moss.
And Moss was there for me, Roy.

276
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,164
Moss was there for me
in a way that you were not,

277
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,921
and now we're together,
and that's all that matters.

278
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,883
I don't know.

279
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,491
- What?
- I don't know, Jen.

280
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,331
I love you, God knows I do.

281
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,603
Your sweet abandon in bed,
your humanitarian work,

282
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,282
and you've given me
two wonderful children in Zenith and Quasar.

283
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,483
But it sounds
like you still have feelings for this young man,

284
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,410
and I'm not sure I can handle that.
I'm not sure at all!

285
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,444
I don't. I don't.
I don't have feelings for this man.

286
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,211
- Yes, you do!
- Oh...

287
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,169
Admit it, Jen! Admit that you have feelings
for me, loudly, here, in front of Alison.

288
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,683
No, I don't.
He means nothing to me, Delina.

289
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,888
Well, you moved on quickly, you bitch!

290
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,402
How dare you call my sexy wife a bitch!

291
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,083
- Do you want to take this outside?
- With pleasure, sir.

292
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,283
I will just get some of my coats.

293
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,523
Excuse me, Alison.

294
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,480
- What now?
- Hadn't really thought this far.

295
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,171
I'll just go and see how they are.

296
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,851
Oh, those bloody bastards!

297
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,568
Well, lovely to see Jen!

298
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,964
See her? I'm shagging her.

299
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,481
Grrrr...

300
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,247
Well, hello there, beautiful.
