1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,482
Which means... which means
a profit so far this year

2
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,730
- of 1800 billion billion.
- Splendid!

3
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,447
And this doesn't even include the added
revenue arising from your takeover of ITV.

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,564
ITV! I'd forgotten about ITV. Brilliant!

5
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,127
Gentlemen, when I first started
Reynholm Industries,

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,561
I had just two things in my possession -

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,081
a dream and 6 million pounds.

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,404
Today I have a business empire
the like of which...

9
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,285
the world has never seen the like of which.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,282
I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say
that I am the greatest man in the world.

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,731
Hear, hear.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,602
Gentlemen, to the future.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,121
Oh, you don't have any glasses.
Just pretend.

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,925
- The future.
- The future.

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,840
Um... Sorry to interrupt,
but there are some policemen here.

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,204
They say they need to speak to you
about irregularities in the pension fund.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,803
I see. Could you make them
a cup of tea, please, Stephanie?

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,967
- Nice.
- Isn't she a beauty?

19
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,481
It's certainly a phone.

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,166
- 160 PPI screen, Wi-Fi enabled...
- Ask me what kind of phone I've got.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,126
- What kind of phone have you got?
- It doesn't matter.

22
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,730
Voice recognition.

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,242
So let's say I wanted to call my mum, all I'd
have to do is say "Mum" and it calls her.

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,480
I don't need to do anything.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,966
- It's the dog's bollocks. Oh, no...
<i>- Hello? Hello?</i>

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,686
Mum, Mum. No... no. I'm sorry.

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,882
No, Moss said that.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,002
Yeah. OK. I'll call you later. Bye.

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,647
Only problem with it is that it's
got a very weedy vibrate setting.

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,206
I mean, it... Watch this. OK.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,691
- I mean, what is that?
- I'll sort it out.

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,610
Oh, could you? Just, you know,
welly up the vibrate on it a bit.

33
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,087
OK, all right.
Now, will you answer this question?

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,486
Oh. Are we still on this?

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,001
Well, you keep interrupting me.
We would have been done ages ago...

36
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,122
All right, all right, OK. Go on.

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,210
Question 39, when was
the last time you exercised?

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,087
Ah. The last time I exercised was... never.

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,761
I'm still reeling
from your answer to question 12.

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,805
- What was question 12?
- You brush your teeth in the bath.

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,402
- So?
- That's where your... balls are.

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,691
OK, question 40,
do you get your five fruit and veg?

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,486
Oh... I mean, I certainly try to.
I would say I probably do.

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,649
- A day.
- A what?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,411
OK, you are going to love this.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,445
This website takes all that information
you just gave me, and guess what it does.

47
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,801
It actually estimates
the date of your death.

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,810
- What?
- I know. Unbelievable, isn't it?

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,164
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. I know
about those. Everyone knows about those.

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,648
Oh, right, so you've already done it.
So, when's the big day?

51
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,242
No! I haven't done it!
Why would I want to do it?

52
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,488
I go March 2, 2079.

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,524
- Oh, my God.
- That's right, baby, I've got 70 more years.

54
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,769
OK, Moss, close that window.
I do not wanna know.

55
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,882
- But I've written it all in now.
- Moss!

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,209
I do not wanna know the date of my death.
Close it.

57
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,761
Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off...?
You know what, I'm sick of saying that.

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,121
What do you want?

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,369
OK. Yeah, someone'll be up in a minute.
Maybe.

60
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,806
You looked!

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,969
You know!
You know when I'm going to die!

62
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,368
- I do, yes.
- I told you not to look.

63
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,246
- I made a mistake.
- Oh!

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,367
When is it?

65
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,165
- You don't wanna know.
- You can't say that to me now!

66
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,727
My advice, Roy, is to
forget all about this.

67
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,764
Why, how long have they given me?
20 years?

68
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,282
It's less than 20?

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,006
You see, I don't think
this is taking into account leap years,

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,408
so that could well be
something to hang on to.

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,566
What does it say, Moss?
Does... does it say I'm already dead?

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,646
- Oh, no, that'd be terrible.
- Thank God.

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,683
- It's Thursday.
- What?

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,963
- It's Thursday.
- Thursday?

75
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,560
Again, remember, leap years.

76
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,206
It's Thursday!
Thursday's the third!

77
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,529
Although not till late afternoon,
so that gives you most of the day.

78
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,769
3pm. How can they be that specific?

79
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,724
- Yeah. It's silly.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,609
- These things are, at best, 79% accurate.
- Oh, good.

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,883
I would take no further notice of it.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,685
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's silly.

83
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,201
I will take no further notice of it.

84
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,889
Apparently there's something wrong with all
the computers on seven. Who wants it? Roy?

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,367
Ooh, you look terrible.

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,642
Are you ill?

87
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,081
I don't know.

88
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,406
This idiot's disabled
the flipping firewall.

89
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,603
Yeah. Hello? Excuse me.

90
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,690
Thank you. Um... Some attention, please.

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,371
I know you don't think
it's important or cool,

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,247
but there is a ruddy good reason why
we put up antiviral software and firewalls.

93
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,489
It's because there are
a lot of dangerous things out there.

94
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,170
Jesus!

95
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,446
Well, you know... All right, calm down.
Just don't disable the firewalls.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,040
OK, 73. That's good, that's good.

97
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,085
And, um...
Mum, what age did Uncle Tony die?

98
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,328
32?!

99
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,444
Oh, it was a car accident! Brilliant! OK.

100
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,723
No, I completely forgot. OK.
Oh, Mum, I have to go.

101
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,049
Unbelievable.
Some brainiac disabled his firewall,

102
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,289
which means that all of the computers
on floor seven are teeming with viruses,

103
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,927
plus I've just had to walk all the way down
the motherfudging stairs

104
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,123
because the lift is broken <i>again.</i>

105
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,208
- Oh, my God.
- What?

106
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,800
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

107
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,251
- Denholm's dead.
- Oh, yes, and Denholm's dead.

108
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
OK, everyone ready?

109
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,250
Wow, you look great.
We should go to more funerals.

110
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,762
Yeah, except is there any chance
that I could, um... not go to this one?

111
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,370
No. Why?

112
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,247
It's just, you know... funerals.
They're so morbid.

113
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,524
Oh, will you please forget this
website nonsense? You are not going to die.

114
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,769
Come on, cheer up.
You're gonna ruin the funeral.

115
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,491
No, you're right, I... I...
Pay no attention to me. I'm being an idiot.

116
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,171
Dead man walking.

117
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,324
Very funny.

118
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,807
You crazy little bastard.

119
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,808
So, when did you last exercise, Jen?

120
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,651
- Ooh, no, you are not gonna do it to me.
- Scared?

121
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,003
No. I happen to think
I have a good few years left.

122
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,805
I take plenty of exercise
and I haven't smoked for three years.

123
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,720
- I didn't know you smoked.
- Oh, yeah. I was on 40 a day by the end.

124
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,164
40 a day? That's 146,002 a decade,
presuming there's two leap years.

125
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,569
- How the flip did you give up?
- Basically pure self-control, Moss.

126
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,651
No, no, I'd never smoke again.
I'd rather lick a tramp.

127
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,570
Derek, hello.

128
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,401
Hello, Jen. Thank you for printing up
those funeral announcements.

129
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,285
Oh, no, no, I enjoyed doing it.

130
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,049
You know, in a... in a...
in a... in a... in a sad way.

131
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,130
- Can I have a word, please?
- Sure.

132
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,720
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

133
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,241
Oh, my phone. Oh, cool.
Have you, um... souped it up?

134
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,729
Yeah, I've totally pimped your phone,
girlfriend.

135
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,962
- Is that the highest setting?
- That... is the lowest setting.

136
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,880
It should come as no surprise to you
that I don't like this department.

137
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,567
Never have, never will.
I see no need for an IT department

138
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,369
and I would much rather use this basement
for something important, like a big toilet.

139
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,121
Ooh, I have to say
that actually is a bit of a surprise.

140
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,605
Really? I did send out a memo.

141
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,769
I didn't get it.
I... I had no idea you felt like this.

142
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,249
Well, I do. However, I am prepared
to give you another chance.

143
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,250
Another chance? But I didn't know
we'd already had a chance.

144
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,491
This should be the first chance. You should
give us this chance and then another chance.

145
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,651
OK, OK.
Now give me a go, give me a go.

146
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,967
- I'm gonna put it up to five.
- OK.

147
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,242
Oh, I'm gonna put it in my pocket!

148
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,530
Put it up to eight, put it up to eight.

149
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,247
I'm not putting it up to eight, Moss.
It'll blow my cock off.

150
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,766
- Go on, go on. Put it up.
- OK, OK, I'll put it up.

151
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,443
You do know
we are burying a great man today?

152
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,090
Did someone else die?

153
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,407
I mean Mr Reynholm!

154
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,770
Yeah.

155
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,290
- "Did someone else die?"
- Well, I didn't know.

156
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,085
You have to be careful. He's our new boss.

157
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
Oh, he hates us. He keeps saying that there
doesn't even need to be an IT department.

158
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,608
Why did no one tell me this?

159
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,088
There was a memo. It just said,
"I hate the IT department."

160
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,407
Oh, no, no, no. No, you are not
coming to the funeral, Richmond.

161
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,888
What funeral?

162
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,649
Oh.

163
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,123
Has anyone got the right time?

164
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,164
- It's twenty to three.
- I make it a quarter to.

165
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,205
Why? Oh, yes, because that website said
you were going to die at three, didn't it?

166
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,483
- Did it? I... I can't remember.
- But how could you forget?

167
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,083
It clearly stated that you were going
to die, today, at precisely three.

168
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,205
Unless it was tomorrow.
But, no, it's today at three.

169
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,766
Will you put it out of your mind?

170
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,850
Right. You're right. Out of my mind.

171
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,165
OK, there's Denholm's wife.

172
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,163
I never know what to say
to people at funerals.

173
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,691
No, neither do I. I'm terrible.

174
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,805
Oh, just say, "I'm sorry for your loss"
then move on.

175
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,328
- He'll be in our prayers.
- Thank you.

176
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,406
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

177
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,126
Move on.

178
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,482
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

179
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,681
It's not like you've lost a pen, is it?

180
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,610
It's... it's so much worse.

181
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,726
- Would you like a pen? I have a spare one.
- No, thank you.

182
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,242
- Please take it.
- Why are you giving it to me?

183
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,167
I don't know.

184
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,611
Swings and roundabouts.

185
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,960
Death!

186
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,887
Death is coming.

187
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,241
Death is here.

188
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,046
Death is outside.
There is no escape.

189
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,688
- I don't like the way Derek's looking at us.
- Death will catch you.

190
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,768
"Hi."

191
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,611
"Who's that knocking at the door?"

192
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,647
- Yes, it's Death. Let him in.
- Is this normal?

193
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,322
Death came for Denholm
just as he will come for you.

194
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,681
Who will be next?

195
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,609
You?

196
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,961
Maybe you.

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,288
- We are gathered here today...
- What's wrong with you?

198
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,131
- To mourn the passing of a great man.
- Nothing.

199
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,168
I've never seen a grandfather clock
in a church before.

200
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,123
Yes, or one with a second hand.

201
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,131
Yes, he had more money
than most of us here today...

202
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,210
but did that make him
a better man?

203
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,566
We know Denholm was a man of money.

204
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,208
Yes, he had more money
than any of us here.

205
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,610
Argh! Oh! Argh!

206
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,491
Oh, no, Jesus! Argh! Argh!

207
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,888
Jesus Christ!
Someone call me an ambulance!

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,846
I'm not <i>joking!</i>
I need an ambulance!

209
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,849
I'm not <i>joking!</i>

210
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,008
Call me a ambulance!

211
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,361
I'm not... Oh.

212
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,728
Oh, no, wait.

213
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,330
It's my phone.

214
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,926
I shouldn't take it... I'll just...

215
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,323
They'll leave a...

216
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,603
I'll turn it off.
I'll just put it on...

217
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,848
Oh, thank

218
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,681
Go on.

219
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,041
Oh, it's gone to message. Um...

220
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,371
Hello, Roy. Nothing important, just wondering
how the funeral went. Call me back.

221
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,802
If we are all quite ready,

222
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,130
Denholm instructed that this short film
be played before the service.

223
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,402
You're all out of here.
You are out of here. You're history!

224
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,801
<i>Hello. If you're watching this
it means I'm dead now,</i>

225
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,809
<i>and it's all thanks to these little things.</i>

226
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,844
- Ha! Wrong!
- Shut up!

227
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,770
<i>Cigarettes have finally killed me, like
they killed my father, my father's father,</i>

228
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,726
<i>my mother's father,
my mother and her father.</i>

229
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,763
<i>I just can't seem to give the
damn things up. I love them.</i>

230
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,880
<i>Sweet, smoky cigarettes.</i>

231
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,962
<i>Ah!</i>

232
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,881
<i>You delicious bastard.</i>

233
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,566
<i>Final thought, Stephanie,</i>

234
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,207
<i>could you categorise the personnel files
alphabetically from now on?</i>

235
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,129
<i>That rhyming thing just isn't working.</i>

236
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,084
<i>Also, cal "Who's Who"
and get them to update my entry.</i>

237
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,123
<i>Well, thanks, everyone, for coming.</i>

238
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,686
<i>Enjoy the rest of the funeral.</i>

239
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,566
Well said, sir.

240
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
I will now ask
Mr Pippen to read the eulogy.

241
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,286
I see a lot of faces out there.

242
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,804
Some of you I know, some of you I hope to
get to know better over the coming months,

243
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,130
some of you I probably won't be
seeing very much of after today.

244
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,690
The reading of the eulogy is a duty
normally left to the eldest child,

245
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,646
but, as you all know, Denholm's son Douglas
mysteriously disappeared

246
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,082
after a lengthy court case seven years ago.

247
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:19,724
Let me start by reading this poem that I saw
in the film <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral.</i>

248
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,489
"Stop all the clocks..."

249
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,602
Father!

250
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,606
Argh!

251
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,451
Tits!

252
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,887
Unhand me, priest. I'll go all day.
Where is your God?

253
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,968
Where is your God now?

254
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,845
Here lies a great man.

255
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,883
A great man!

256
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,526
Father!

257
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,170
- I miss anything?
- Just the start of Derek's eulogy.

258
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,129
You stink.

259
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,891
I just smoked a cigarette from the drain.

260
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,327
Well, who's this?

261
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,727
- Hi, I'm Douglas.
- Jen Barber.

262
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,084
That's a beautiful second name.
What are you doing after the funeral, Jen?

263
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,722
- Douglas.
- Speak, priest.

264
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,765
No, I'm a bit... Your father prepared a second
tape in the event of your sudden arrival.

265
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,566
A second tape? I see.

266
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,889
- Actually, I don't follow.
- I'll just put it on.

267
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,925
<i>Hello again.</i>

268
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,602
<i>If you're watching this, it's because
my son from my first marriage has arrived,</i>

269
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,963
<i>caused a scene and is currently chatting up
some nearby trollop.</i>

270
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,650
- Hey!
- Quiet, woman!

271
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,127
<i>Douglas, I have something important
to tell you.</i>

272
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,730
I'm here, Papa.

273
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,491
<i>Reynholm Industries is now yours.</i>

274
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,807
My Lord. Thank you, Father.

275
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,002
<i>But it's yours at a price.</i>

276
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,329
<i>I want you to promise me now,
in font of all your new employees,</i>

277
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,727
<i>that you will never again become embroiled</i>

278
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,923
<i>in a sexual harassment case
that damages the company.</i>

279
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,361
I promise, Father.

280
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,050
<i>There's one more thing, Douglas,
but it's for your ears only,</i>

281
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,085
<i>so I want you to stop the tape, take it
home and watch it again later in private.</i>

282
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,250
But these are my new family, Father.
I hold no secrets from them.

283
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,011
<i>OK, Douglas, now we're alone
I can speak frankly.</i>

284
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,407
<i>You may well receive a visit
from the police at some point</i>

285
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,000
<i>concerning irregularities
in the pension fund.</i>

286
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,531
Turn that off.

287
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,725
<i>I've been using a very creative accountant,
recently released from jail,</i>

288
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,923
- <i>to manage what I calla suck fund.</i>
- Let me do it. Where's the remote?

289
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,921
- <i>Now, the suck fund...</i>
- I'll do it myself!

290
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,407
Goodbye, Father.

291
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,290
Right, I'm off. I'll see you all on Monday.

292
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,971
Douglas, Douglas.
Sorry... didn't mean to, um...

293
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,243
Derek Pippen.
I worked very closely with your father.

294
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,089
Oh, Derek, good to meet you.

295
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,125
I'm afraid I'll be bringing in my own
people, so you're immediately fired.

296
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,928
OK, good luck, everyone,
and, uh... I'll see <i>you</i> later.

297
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,527
And you are ready to go.

298
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,723
Brilliant. Thank you, computer man.

299
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,486
I'm told my father was particularly proud
of the IT department,

300
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,924
run by a dynamic go-getter,
a genius and a man from Ireland.

301
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,008
Yes, one last thing. How do I erase files
like this one here marked "pensions"?

302
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,409
Um... just like this.

303
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,126
All gone. Wonderful. Thanks, guys.

304
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,562
I'll be working very closely
with your department,

305
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,449
and I have a feeling I'll be needing you for a
lot more than just deleting incriminating files.

306
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,961
I just mean files.

307
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,769
OK, we'd better be off.

308
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,410
By the way, where's that hootsie-tootsie,
humdinging, coochie mama boss of yours?

309
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,205
Um... she went home early.

310
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,641
She said she had some catching up to do.

311
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,803
Oh, one last thing.

312
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,809
I sorted out this for you.

313
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,402
Now, I'm afraid the vibrate setting
is still a little weedy,

314
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,285
so you may wanna put her
all the way up to ten.

315
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,804
Ten?

316
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,843
Shall do.

317
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,362
Done, and done.

318
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,128
OK, bye-bye.

319
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,285
Sorry about this, old man.

320
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,201
Oh, yes.

321
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,165
Shh!

322
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,489
Ooh.

323
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,321
Ooh. Now, I like that.

324
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,602
Ooh.

325
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,246
Ooh. Mm.

326
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,045
Mm. Ohh.

327
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,083
Nearly at the station!
