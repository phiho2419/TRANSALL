1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,162
And every other day,
I take a short helicopter ride

2
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,601
to Heston Blumenthal's restaurant.

3
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,964
Last night, I ate a chocolate radio
that still worked in my stomach,

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,607
and a flat chicken
that was actually a glass of water.

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,441
Even the menu was edible.
They said it wasn't, but I ate it.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,409
Sounds like you're living
the life of Riley.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,889
Well, I actually knew Riley,
and yes, there are similarities.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,644
And yet, there is some sadness
in your life.

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,171
Tell me about Victoria.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,250
Well, you'll have to forgive me,
there's been quite a few Victorias.

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,566
Your wife?

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,763
Oh, my God, my wife. Oh, yes, Victoria.

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,601
What a fantastic woman.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,883
The two weeks we were married
were unforgettable.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,321
She disappeared in mysterious
circumstances, did she not?

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,446
She vanished while washing the car.

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,202
Despite a search
that lasted nearly five hours,

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,642
we found nothing.
So naturally, we assumed the worst.

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,610
You must miss her.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,644
More than words could say.

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,251
I'd give anything to see her
walk through that door right now.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,890
Hey, why don't you
take your clothes off?

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,929
- What?
- Come on, we both knew

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,681
it was on the cards
as soon as I realised you were a woman.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,529
What if someone were to walk in?

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,645
I left strict instructions
not to be disturbed in case we had sex.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,206
There's no way
anyone's walking through that...

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,401
Hello, Douglas.

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,363
Victoria!

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,571
But I thought you were dead!

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,131
I must say, Douglas, you still
don't seem very pleased to see me.

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,967
No, no, no, no.

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,811
I must have eaten
some bad stereo system.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,122
- How's the wine?
- Exquisite.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,322
From the chef's own cellar.

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,642
What are you doing, Victoria?
Last time I saw you, you were...

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,807
Washing the car?

38
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
Yes, I imagine you have many questions.

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,249
I was under a lot of stress
that day, Douglas.

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,204
I think we both were.
We both knew it wasn't working.

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,290
I picked up my sponge and bucket
with a heavy heart that day.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,640
The rest is a blank.

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,250
The next thing I can remember
with any clarity

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,364
is being on a kayaking holiday
two years later.

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,845
That looks good. What's that?

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,201
Oh, I sort of wish I'd ordered that.

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,891
Our invisible desserts have arrived.

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,081
I know we weren't happy for that
second week of our marriage, Douglas,

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,568
but what do you say to giving us
another chance, as a couple?

50
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,762
I don't know.

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,770
I don't think we can just pick up
from where we left off.

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,451
No, Victoria, I'm sorry, it's over.

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,806
Oh, God.

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,522
I forgot you could do that.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,771
Maybe we should give it another go.

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,444
Well, that is new.

57
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,481
How are you doing that?

58
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,409
That might be the dog.

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,168
Heston, I'd like to introduce you
to my wife.

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,648
I want to divorce my wife.

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,410
Why are you telling me?

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,284
Aren't you with Legal?

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,401
No.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,245
Remind me.

65
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,648
IT? Relationship Manager?

66
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,931
Ah, well, then I probably
shouldn't have told you any of that.

67
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,011
Anyway, I want to divorce her right now.

68
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,688
Now's too late. Before now.

69
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,043
In fact, I want to have
already divorced her. Is that possible?

70
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,162
Well, as I said, I'm not a lawyer, so...

71
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,365
Yes, but you're a relationship manager,
and this is a relationship.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,446
Well, um, have you told her yet?

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,286
Kind of.

74
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,650
I changed my FriendFace profile
from "Married" to "It's Complicated".

75
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,641
That's not the same as telling her,
Mr Reynholm.

76
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,489
Yeah, but someone will pass it on,
why not you?

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,762
- No!
- Oh, come on!

78
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,486
Please break up
with my vanishing car-cleaning wife,

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,647
I don't want to do it.

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,125
I don't want to do it!

81
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,489
I'll give you, I don't know, £10,000.

82
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,004
Who are you again?

83
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,690
I'm Jen Barber.

84
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,247
I'm with the IT Department
at Reynholm Industries.

85
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,090
Sorry, I thought
I was meeting my husband.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,967
Mmm. Er, Mr Reynholm asked me
to convey a, um, a message to you.

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,326
Um...

88
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,491
Mrs Reynholm, how long have you
and Mr Reynholm known each other?

89
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,965
- About 10 years.
- Ten years.

90
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,889
Ten wonderful years.

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,085
Who are you?

92
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,682
Mrs Reynholm... Can I call you Victoria?

93
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,529
- No.
- Mrs Reynholm,

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,604
sometimes there is a day

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,882
and then there is a night.

96
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,168
Sometimes, there is a morn.

97
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,490
And then there is an eve, flowers grow,
trees are cut down.

98
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,763
Babies are born but, um, lawyers exist.

99
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,524
What are you trying to say?

100
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,531
Oh, I can't do it, I just can't.

101
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,441
Let me guess.
My husband wants to leave me

102
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,050
and he paid you a large amount of money

103
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,367
so that you would spare him
the embarrassment of facing me.

104
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,690
Yes, but I'm not going to
take the money. I feel sick.

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,167
Of course you do.
You're a normal person.

106
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,841
- You're not upset?
- No, because I'm not a normal person.

107
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,328
You see, what you're trying to do here
but can't,

108
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,523
if the tables were turned,
I wouldn't find it difficult at all.

109
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,644
In fact, it's how I met his first wife.

110
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,682
Oh, I didn't know
these were edible, too.

111
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,290
They're not.

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,407
What's all that?

113
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,329
I have to spend the afternoon
with Douglas.

114
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,887
Somehow I've been drafted
into his legal eagle fantasy.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,241
Have you ever spent
any serious time with that man?

116
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,407
He's unbelievable.

117
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,443
You should hear the way
he talks about women.

118
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,005
Oh, yeah, he's some piece of work.

119
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,168
He's like a sexy Hitler.

120
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,281
I mean, I don't expect
to be put on a peddle stool,

121
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,687
but please, just show a little respect.

122
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,121
Uh, I'm sorry.
You don't expect to be put on a what?

123
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,049
On a, on a peddle stool.

124
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,685
A peddle stool?

125
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,603
What's a peddle stool?

126
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,685
Oh, you know, you put women on it

127
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,451
when you admire them,
you know, the phrase.

128
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,724
Oh, yeah, no, the famous phrase
"to be put on a peddle stool".

129
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,370
Pedestal!

130
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,682
- What?
-"Pedestal" is the word!

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,889
What's a peddle stool?

132
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,729
Did you really think there was
such a thing as a peddle stool?

133
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,411
Shut up, everyone has blind spots.

134
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,125
Uh, can you, uh, come and help me

135
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,607
sort through all this legal crap,
please, Moss?

136
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,929
I'd rather not, I've not had
good experiences with the legal system.

137
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,041
How come?

138
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,324
Well, when I was 11 , I broke
the patio window and my mother sued me.

139
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,484
She sued you?

140
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,161
Yeah, um, to teach me a lesson.

141
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,564
She's always been
a very aggressive litigator.

142
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,081
Can you even do that?
Can you sue your children?

143
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,170
It was kind of a show trial
in the kitchen.

144
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,890
She made a little gallery for the cats.

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,525
Aw.

146
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,926
What happened?

147
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,246
She won.

148
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,008
I'm still paying costs.

149
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,607
Peddle stool.

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,764
212 million quid? You can't be serious!

151
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,723
Oh, we're quite serious, Mr Reynholm.

152
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,242
But that's enough to bring
Reynholm Industries to its knees.

153
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,886
Bloody blast! This is up my arse!

154
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,646
That is the amount.
It is not up for negotiation.

155
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,081
Balls from hell, you shit twins.

156
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,041
Calm down, Mr Reynholm.

157
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,845
Bollocks to be telling me to calm down,
my old chap.

158
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,645
She wants 220 titty million quid

159
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,330
and you tell me to calm down?

160
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,408
- You're fired.
- I'm not your lawyer.

161
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,567
Piss off!

162
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,205
I'm going to represent myself.

163
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,448
I'm not your lawyer.

164
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,802
You sit there, all confident.

165
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,567
Yeah? But when this goes to court,
that's when the talking stops.

166
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,045
Mr Reynholm.

167
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,602
Uh, there might actually be
more talking in court.

168
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,449
This would actually be
a comparatively small amount

169
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,449
of talking, what we're doing here.

170
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,925
- Oh, I see.
- Sorry.

171
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,249
No, no, that's all right.
It's what I pay you for.

172
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,290
Look at her, cold as ice.

173
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,447
But I tell you this.

174
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,166
Behind those shades, she's terrified.

175
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,449
One thing you should know
about me, Jen,

176
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,689
when I put my mind to something,
it gets done.

177
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,327
Representing myself
is the kind of challenge I relish.

178
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,960
Well, you'll have to do
a lot of preparation.

179
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,445
Bring it on.

180
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,049
Uh, what's this?

181
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,804
It's my suit. I made it myself.
Took me a few days.

182
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,651
Um, how did you find time
to prepare for the trial?

183
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,330
How did I what?

184
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,530
Mrs Reynholm, you say
that in the short time you were married,

185
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,120
you became indispensable to Mr Reynholm.

186
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,686
In what way were you indispensable?

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,729
I had to brush his teeth.

188
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,330
- Really?
- Yes.

189
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,371
- Well, that's not an expression?
- No.

190
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,011
You got the brush.

191
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,805
You applied toothpaste to it.

192
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,161
You moved it into his mouth.

193
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,210
You moved your hand up and down.

194
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,207
Well, if I didn't do it,
he wouldn't do it.

195
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,482
Make a note. "Brush teeth."

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,287
Now, you're asking
for quite a large amount.

197
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,811
I think it is an appropriate amount.

198
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,206
Bollocks.

199
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,885
Mr Reynholm.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,207
Yes, Your Honour?

201
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,405
I would ask you to refrain from using
that kind of language in my courtroom.

202
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,682
And which word in particular

203
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,531
do you object to, Your Honour?

204
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,929
You only said one.

205
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,724
- Could you read it back?
- Mmm...

206
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,127
-"Bollocks."
- Don't read it back!

207
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,730
Why do you say
it is an appropriate amount?

208
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,244
Mr Reynholm caused me great distress.

209
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,488
I feel I'm entitled to some restitution.

210
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,570
Besides, it's not as if he ever put
the money to good use,

211
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,205
as the film proves.

212
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,448
Your Honour, may I present
the central exhibit to our case?

213
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,370
It is, I'm afraid, a sex tape.

214
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,165
A sex tape?

215
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,605
Which one?

216
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,411
The alien craft
appears to have dropped its shields.

217
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,320
Thank you, Female Chekov.
Female Sulu, beam their captain aboard.

218
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,091
But Captain, are you sure?

219
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,328
But she's hurt. She may need our help.

220
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,841
Jim,
even if she's injured as you say,

221
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,090
I can't do an examination on a new
species without proper research.

222
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,890
Damn it, Jim!

223
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,931
I'm a sexy doctor, not a sexy scientist.

224
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,726
Female Sulu, you have your orders.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,606
Perhaps the good doctor thinks
that certain alien species

226
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,688
- do not fall under the Hippocratic Oath.

227
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,849
I have never refused treatment
to a patient, Female Spock,

228
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,371
and you know that.

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,210
- I think we've seen enough.
- Your Honour, I object.

230
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,286
There's a brilliant bit coming up.

231
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,968
Mr Reynholm. Are you ready to start
your cross-examination of Mrs Reynholm?

232
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,525
I am, Your Honour.

233
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,361
But rest assured,
it will be a normal examination.

234
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,642
I am not in any way cross.

235
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,130
You are Victoria Reynholm, are you not?

236
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,289
Mr Reynholm,
we have already established that.

237
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,562
Might I suggest you try
less to do an impression

238
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,842
of a lawyer you once saw
on the television

239
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,885
and make your case
as simply as you possibly can?

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,128
Wise words, my learned lord.

241
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,241
Victoria, you've spoken about
the real me,

242
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,841
and I think it's time we heard
a little about the real you.

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,369
Isn't it true that you used to be a man?

244
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,121
No.

245
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,562
It isn't true, you say?

246
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,125
It is untrue.

247
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,643
Who am I thinking of?

248
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,366
I think you mean April,
the woman you had a fight with.

249
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,487
No further questions, my lord.

250
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,361
What? Your entire case rested on that?

251
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,448
- Yes, Your Honour.
- No. Wait, Mr Reynholm.

252
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,766
You can't leave it at that.

253
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,521
Uh, You Honour, may I confer
with my relationship manager?

254
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,171
- What's up, Jen?
- Um,

255
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,921
you've got to request more time
to prepare a proper defence.

256
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,122
Your Grace, may I approach the bench?

257
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,924
Have you brushed your teeth?

258
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,042
- No.
- Then you may not.

259
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,090
Your Grace,

260
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,251
I need to prepare a proper defence.

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,571
The one I just did there was rubbish.

262
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,488
Yes. He's some piece of work.

263
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,809
Aye. We're all very happy
at Reynholm Industries.

264
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,927
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yes.

265
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,643
Then why are you so ill at ease?

266
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,046
Well...

267
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,526
If you must know,
I was in a court myself, recently.

268
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,802
This very courtroom, in fact,

269
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,447
where I gave testimony
against a former soldier who...

270
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,650
I was having a massage and he kissed me
on my bottom, Your Honour.

271
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,247
I see.

272
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,567
I'm sure you can understand
my discomfort.

273
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,569
Are you all right? Can you continue?

274
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,762
I can continue, thank you.

275
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,450
The way you tell it, your employer
sounds like a paragon of virtue.

276
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,891
That's right.

277
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,321
And furthermore,
I would like to say at this point

278
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,569
that I think this whole case
to be a damp squid.

279
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,088
Thank you. No further questions.

280
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,044
Ooh, I have one more
question, Your Honour.

281
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,208
- Yes?
- Uh, what did you say?

282
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,363
- What?
- What did you say the case was?

283
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,244
May I have it read back, please?

284
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,409
"I believe this entire case
to be a bit of a damp squid."

285
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,522
A damp squid?

286
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,721
What does that mean?

287
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,808
Oh, no, Jen. It's, um...

288
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,084
It's an expression.
Uh, it means that I believe

289
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,884
that everything
that's been said in this case

290
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,331
-everyone already knew.
- Mmm, yes.

291
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,169
But did you say "damp squid"?

292
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,409
- That's right.
- Did you not mean "damp squib"?

293
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,768
No. It's "squid".

294
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,121
What's a squib?

295
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,289
It's not "squid".
Squids are already damp.

296
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,084
Hence the phrase.

297
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,890
Your Honour, please.

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,490
It is "squib".

299
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,762
I must say, I find it extraordinary

300
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,723
that you, a man in your early thirties,

301
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,205
could have reached
this point in your life

302
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,290
without knowing that it is "squib".

303
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,925
- I think it's "squid".
- I have no further questions.

304
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,644
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
- That will be all.

305
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,162
- Everyone has a blind spot.
- I said, that will be all!

306
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,409
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

307
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,882
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

308
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,286
Sorry.

309
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,649
Bit nervous, so, yeah.

310
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,884
It's fizzy. It's very fizzy.
It's fizzy, it's gone fizzy.

311
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,809
-- Ow! Come on!

312
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,764
That's electric.
It's electric in there.

313
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,166
It's, uh...

314
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,691
Got a shock.

315
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,289
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

316
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,245
It is not.

317
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,567
Sorry, yeah. Sorry, um...

318
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,049
My mother sued me.

319
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,209
Just, um, relax. Take your time.

320
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,688
Try to answer the questions
as clearly as you can.

321
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,484
Thank you, my love.

322
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,440
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

323
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,522
Chair. It's...just the chair's faulty.

324
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,441
No further questions, my lord.

325
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,210
Don't you have anything?

326
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,529
She's going to take you
to the cleaners, Mr Reynholm.

327
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,768
Yep. I suppose she will.

328
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,845
What's that?

329
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,009
Oh, God. I think I may
have found our miracle.

330
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,087
Can you state your full name, please?

331
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,086
Richmond Felicity Avenor.

332
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,282
And you worked at
Reynholm Industries for a time.

333
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,925
I did. For over four years.

334
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,520
- And what did you do?
- I don't know.

335
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,486
Why did you leave?

336
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,602
Well, my life wasn't really
going anywhere.

337
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,485
I was part of the whole
Goth/death metal subculture.

338
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,728
But it wasn't making me happy.

339
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,842
It was all a bit gloomy.

340
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,481
It's round about that point
that I developed scurvy.

341
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,524
Ooh. Now, that sounds unpleasant.

342
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,641
On the contrary.

343
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,570
Catching scurvy was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

344
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,489
Made me take
a long, hard look in the mirror.

345
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,171
And I didn't like what I saw,
I can tell you that.

346
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,282
Not just because
my teeth had fallen out.

347
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,410
Which is why I founded
"From Goth 2 Boss".

348
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,329
Is it okay if I play a DVD?

349
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,569
Does it have anything whatsoever
to do with this case?

350
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,011
Not really, Your Honour.

351
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,929
Then you may proceed.

352
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,849
Where are you going? Is it to the top?

353
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,371
If not, why not?

354
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,811
Go to the bloody top.

355
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,410
Is it because you're a Goth?

356
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,409
Did you know that Goths
have some of the lowest

357
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,966
life satisfaction levels
of any subculture,

358
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,764
with the exception of traffic wardens?

359
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,769
That's why you don't see
any Goth traffic wardens.

360
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,008
That would be a deadly combination.

361
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,011
We at "Goth 2 Boss" work with Goths
at various locations around the UK

362
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,804
to bring out their hidden potential,

363
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,524
By encouraging them to engage in

364
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,722
- everyday healthy pursuits.
- Everyday healthy pursuits.

365
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,320
- Such as sports.

366
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,647
- Mixing with other humans.
- Yay!

367
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,161
- Extended laughter sessions.

368
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,681
Introducing colour to your wardrobe.

369
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,040
Just look at these results.

370
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,447
This is Debbie.
She used to hang around railway stations

371
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,848
with her hands in her sleeves.
Now she's a lifeguard in Mumbai.

372
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,122
"From Goth 2 Boss. "
You know it makes sense.

373
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,129
Unless you're not a Goth,
in which case...

374
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,969
"From Goth 2 Boss"
remember the name.

375
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,328
But what does this have to do with
my divorce proceedings, my kind fellow?

376
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,250
Well, Mr Reynholm,
I'm here to tell you that that woman

377
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,328
is not Victoria Reynholm.

378
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,925
Her name is Melanie Crawford,

379
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,850
a former "From Goth 2 Boss"
pupil of mine.

380
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,402
Sing, you canary.

381
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,646
Well, during our sessions,

382
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,604
she seemed more interested in you
than getting any better.

383
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,849
I don't think she ever truly
exorcised the Goth within.

384
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,769
Scratch away that fake tan

385
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,248
and beneath you'll find
the purest white foundation.

386
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,163
Yeah, that was more
of a phrase than anything.

387
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,246
Oh, actually, um...
No, sorry. That's not her.

388
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,411
Oh, sorry about that.
Um, that's not her.

389
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,450
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

390
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,530
you've heard a few things
over the past few days,

391
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,928
none of which cast me in
a particularly favourable light.

392
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,326
Stories

393
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,408
of expensive sex tapes.

394
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,000
Rumours of me killing my first wife.

395
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,691
No, no one's mentioned that.

396
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,888
But you know,
there's one thing I do want to say.

397
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,764
Just one thing...that I...

398
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,805
Mr Reynholm?

399
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,649
Mr Reynholm, please.

400
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,367
Mr Reynholm, this really is

401
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,562
the most pathetic display
I think I've ever seen.

402
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,250
May I say something, Your Honour?

403
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,725
Why not?

404
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,611
Lying here,

405
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,001
pretending to have a heart attack,

406
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,884
you see a desperate man.

407
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,161
Not pretending!

408
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,490
A man who has exhausted all of his time,
all of his resources,

409
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,571
on an expensive trial
that has resulted in...

410
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,164
humiliation.

411
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,680
But think not of him.

412
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,804
Think of the employees
of Reynholm Industries.

413
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,440
Think of the man
who was sued by his mother,

414
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,090
the simpleton who thought the phrase
"damp squid" was correct.

415
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,522
These are the people I want you to
consider when making your judgment.

416
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,008
For Reynholm is not just the name
of this ridiculous man

417
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,920
who keeps opening his eyes
whenever he thinks no one's looking,

418
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,805
Reynholm is the name of the family

419
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,571
his employees have found in each other.

420
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,482
We are all Reynholms.

421
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,291
Hurt him

422
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,326
-and you hurt...
- Oh, all right, then,

423
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,091
-we'll take 70 million.
- Hooray!

424
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,241
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

425
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,964
I'm getting oak.

426
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,970
- Mmm.
- Right.

427
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,010
Cheers!
