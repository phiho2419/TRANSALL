1
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,490
Hey!

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,365
I just won 450 quid playing poker.

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,201
- Well done.
- Saw that one coming, Mikey 73.

4
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,802
That's my rent sorted this month.
Ooh, and I can buy that new...

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,730
Oh, no, I've lost it all again.

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,164
- <i>Jen?</i>
- Oh, Philip. Hello. Hi.

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,047
This is Philip from six.
This is Moss and Roy.

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,127
- Hi.
- Hi.

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,571
Hiya.

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,490
So, what brings you to my lair?

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,646
Not that I'm some sort of animal.

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,650
Or... or maybe I am.

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,649
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,723
Oh, um, I was just, uh, wondering
if, uh, you, um, had the latest <i>Heat.</i>

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,081
Ha. Yes, yes, there it is.

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,923
Thanks. And... Sorry about this,
I don't suppose maybe...

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,362
you'd like to come to the theatre
tomorrow night? Maybe? Or...?

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,404
I'd be delighted.

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,569
- He means me, Moss.
- He was looking at me.

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,206
- No, he wasn't.
- I think he was.

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,042
- You're not even in his eye line.
- Philip, who are you talking to? Me or Jen?

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,243
- Do you like the theatre?
- Never been.

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,569
But I've, uh... I've always liked
the idea of the theatre -

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,207
the smell of the grease,
the roar of the paint.

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,051
I've often thought
if I hadn't ended up in computers,

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,969
I would have gone into the theatre.

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,128
- But you've never been to see a play?
- No.

28
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,730
Why not?

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,810
Never had the interest.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,048
- Are there any famous people in it?
- No.

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,447
It's a pass from me, then, thank you.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,849
- You haven't been invited anyway.
- Oh, wait. Uh, Laura Knightly's in it.

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,807
Laura Knightly from <i>The Bill?</i>

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,366
She's gorgeous. You know what?

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,482
I will come, Philip, thank you.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,001
There's no invitation.
Show me the invitation.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,170
I guess you could come too. I know people
in the show, so tickets aren't a problem.

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,408
- Great. That's settled, then.
- Right.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,286
Well, I'll give you a call later, then,
give you the details. How's that?

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,847
That is perfection itself, Philip.
Thanks for coming down, man.

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,724
Catch you later.

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,401
That could have been a date there.

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,648
Now it's a...

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,331
work outing.

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,171
- Sorry, I nearly forgot the <i>Heat.</i>
- Oh, yes.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,807
It's, uh... That's... Um...

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,161
Ahh.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,247
What?

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,886
He actually did want to borrow
the copy of <i>Heat.</i>

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,765
- So?
- Well, it's just... you know.

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,168
- Huh. No, I don't. What?
- I'm just surprised.

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,331
Why?

53
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,286
It's just I don't know many
heterosexual men who read <i>Heat.</i>

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,009
Huh. What, he's gay just because
he reads Heatmagazine?

55
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,806
Um, well, he's either gay
or a woman in her early twenties.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,204
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,290
Why else would he ask me out on a date?

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,767
Are you sure he meant
it as a "date" date?

59
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,043
Are you sure you're not going along
as his gal pal?

60
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,608
If you're talking about who I think you're
talking about, the answer is yes, he is gay.

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,325
- How do you know?
- Oh, everyone knows.

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,570
And what's more,
he's been gay since Wham!

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,883
We're talking about Philip.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,403
- He borrowed <i>Heat.</i>
- He borrowed <i>Heat?</i> Ooh, la la.

65
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,091
And he "knows people in the theatre".

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,842
That's not a euphemism. He actually
does know people in the theatre.

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,965
Anyway, it's a date, I'm sure it is.
Why else would he ask me out?

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,642
Well, don't take this the wrong way,
but could he have thought you were a man?

69
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,601
- Let's get a taxi.
- It's a ten-minute walk.

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,290
No, I don't like walkin'.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,085
Why don't you just not come?
You wouldn't have to walk anywhere.

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,487
I won't spoil your romantic evening
with the gay man.

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,047
- He's not a gay man.
- He reads <i>Heat.</i>

74
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,326
- Hey, where are you lot off to?
- Oh, look. Richmond's still alive.

75
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,001
- We're going to the theatre. Want to come?
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

76
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,885
- And you shouldn't go either.
- Why not?

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,082
An ill wind is blowing.

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,047
Last night I was stirred from my slumber
by a crow calling three times.

79
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,969
Caw.

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,441
Caw.

81
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,007
Well, you know what a crow sounds like.
Passing to my window,

82
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,841
I trod on a piece of Lego.
Oh, it went right in the heel.

83
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,282
Turning on my television set,
I noticed the reception wasn't great.

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,051
Not terrible, just not great.

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,166
Hear me well - no good can come of your trip
to the theatre tonight. No good at all.

86
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,248
And if you ask me...

87
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,048
That's just bloody rude.

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,888
Where's my <i>Heat?</i>

89
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,248
A gay musical called <i>Gay!.</i>

90
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,008
That's quite gay.

91
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,251
Gay musical?
Aren't all musicals gay?

92
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,967
This must be, like,
the gayest musical ever made.

93
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,606
It's got some pretty good reviews.

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,201
"The story of a young man trying to find his
sexuality in the uncaring Thatcher years."

95
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,211
"Warning - includes scenes
of graphic homoeroticism."

96
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,243
Ugh! No!

97
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,442
It's set in the '80s.

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,721
"Graphic homoeroticism."
Does that mean they're gonna get them out?

99
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,969
- Not comfortable with your sexuality?
- I'm very comfortable with mine.

100
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,243
I just don't want to be slapped in the face
with their sexuality.

101
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,124
Oh, look, there's Philip.

102
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,481
Oh, look, he's leching at that lady.

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,241
Thank God for that.
He's just an ordinary ignorant man.

104
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,526
- Oh, hey. You're already here.
- Yes.

105
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,043
What are we doing, Roy? This isn't us.
It takes place in the past.

106
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,970
Forget the play.
Philip knows the cast.

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,243
It's all about the backstage party
afterwards. Those things are great.

108
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,880
You go up to everyone, tell them they were
brilliant, and it's free white wine all night.

109
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,566
And besides,
I really wanna meet Laura Knightly.

110
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,889
Hey, the guys. Wow!

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,287
Looks great, doesn't it?

112
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,086
Right, we should really
pick up our tickets.

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,323
I know someone who gets the tickle.

114
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,728
- Sorry, I love doing that to him.
- Hey!

115
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,287
This is Jerome. He does publicity
for the show. He got us our tickets.

116
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,688
- Oh, great. Thanks.
- This is Jen, and Moss, and Roy.

117
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,121
- Hello, hello.
- Hello. How's it going?

118
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,971
Oh, my God, you're Irish.
I love Irish people.

119
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,243
They're just mad, aren't they?
They're just mad.

120
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,409
- We're all insane, yeah.
- Well, you'll luv dis.

121
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,285
It's groit crack.

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,443
I'm mad for crack.

123
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,723
OK, well, quick, everyone.
Show's about to start.

124
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,521
I hope Laura Knightly isn't gonna be
dressed up like Toyah or something.

125
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,846
Who is she in <i>The</i> Billagain?

126
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,406
She plays that heroin addict
that gets stabbed in the face.

127
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,285
- Oh, she is lovely.
- Isn't she lovely?

128
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,244
- Oh, God, here we go.
- It might be all right.

129
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,969
Yeah. How bad can it be?

130
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,685
Welcome to the United...

Brilliant.

133
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,529

He can't say that. Can he?

It's too gay for me.
Thought I could handle it, but I can't.

149
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,404
- It'll be the interval soon.
- Well, I'm captivated, Roy.

150
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,967
Calm down. At least it can't get any worse.

151
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,842
All right, get them house lights up.
Let's have a look at you.

152
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,167
You wearing that shirt for a bet?

153
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,248
Audience participation. Go, go, go.

154
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,604
Ooh, what have we here?

155
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,210
Hello.

156
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,848
So, tell me, who wears the trousers
in this relationship?

157
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,410
What? Oh, right. No, we're not homosexuals,
we're just very good friends.

158
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,841
- So you never had a look?
- At what?

159
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,883
His bum!

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,289
I've seen it, um,
when he squatted in front of my desk,

161
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,609
or should he bend over
to pick something up.

162
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,200
I'd love to work in that office.

163
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
Oh, there's nothing sexual going on.

164
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,288
I do like Roy, but I'm not "curious".

165
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,044
What were you engaging him for?

166
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,006
He was asking me questions. I couldn't
just ignore him. It'd be rude, Roy.

167
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,203
- So what do you think of it?
- I think it's fabulous.

168
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,291
Every value I've ever held
is being questioned, and I'm loving it.

169
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,647
- You don't like it, do you?
- The songs are good.

170
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,809
No, they're not.
Hum one of the songs.

171
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,731
♪ Willies, willies, I like willies

172
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,285
- It's "I love willies".
- What?

173
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,927
- I <i>love</i> willies.
- Sir, could you keep it down?

174
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,647
- I'm not going back in there.
- Oh, yes, you are.

175
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,924
Oh, no. I'll wait out here for you, but there
is no way I'm going anywhere near that thing.

176
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,930
Oh, you can't leave me alone.
I don't know what the hell's going on.

177
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,681
He's laughing like an idiot
at every single gay reference.

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,408
- Why didn't he come out for a drink?
- He doesn't want to miss anything.

179
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,329
I need to wee-wee.

180
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,442
Yeah, me too.

181
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,601
- Oh, what's wrong?
- They've got a toilet guy.

182
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,087
Ohh! I hate toilet guys.

183
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,886
Oh, let's just get it over with.

184
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,168
Thank you.

185
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,648
Cheers, dude.

186
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,643
- Did you go?
- No. Did you?

187
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,209
No. How could I with that bloke
stood looking at us? What was that?

188
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,081
- It's not my fault he works in a toilet.
- How much did you give him?

189
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,846
A pound. I just paid a pound
not to go to the toilet.

190
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,291
He's a terrible toilet guy.

191
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,210
He should work somewhere where people
don't want to go to the toilet.

192
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,721
- I'm gonna use the disabled.
- You can't use the disabled.

193
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,242
- What? Why not?
- You're not disabled. You'll get in trouble.

194
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,045
It's not like a parking space, Moss.

195
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,370
I think... I think it's OK. Isn't it?
It's OK, I'm always using the disabled.

196
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,928
It's illegal.

197
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,808
I don't think so.

198
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,884
Oh!

199
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,921
Ah...

200
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,442
Hello? Hello? You all right in there?

201
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,286
Um...

202
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,562
Do you need help?

203
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,843
- I'm disabled.
- He sounds disoriented.

204
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,531
- Move back from the door.
- What? No.

205
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,248
Oh!

206
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,081
- What are you doing?
- Don't panic.

207
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,968
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's happening?

208
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,367
- Someone's had an accident.
- What?

209
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,324
Well, you'd better keep going, then.

210
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,691
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- I fell off the toilet.

211
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,165
Well, come on, let's get...
let's get you upright.

212
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,282
Thank you.

213
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,608
So, uh, what happened?

214
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,648
- I'm disabled.
- How?

215
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,805
- How what?
- How are you disabled?

216
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,642
- Uh, leg disabled.
- Uh, wh-which...?

217
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,603
Do you have a wheelchair?

218
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,087
- Yes.
- Where?

219
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,847
Stolen.

220
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,849
How did they get in?

221
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,920
- I don't know.
- All right, all right, all right.

222
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,805
Let's get you out of here. Come on.
Give me a hand.

223
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,924
There you go. There you go.
There you go, mate.

224
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,169
All right. You're all right.
You're all right. There you go.

225
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,965
All right. That's it.
There you go. Easy, now.

226
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,369
- That way.
- Right. Nice and steady.

227
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,563
Easy. Gently, gently.

228
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,923
All right, bring him.
Careful, careful. That's it, that's it.

229
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,408
Excuse me,
you know this is the staff toilet?

230
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,364
Yes. I'm staff.

231
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,641
I really am feeling much better.

232
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,842
You can all go now.

233
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,488
We're not going anywhere
until we've got you sorted out.

234
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,411
- Ah, here's Paul with the wheelchair.
- Oh, right. What?

235
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,209
I keep one in the office for emergencies.
Let's get you up.

236
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,369
Nice and gently now.
That's it, that's it. There we are.

237
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,448
OK? There we are.

238
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,810
- Oh, the police.
- Everything all right here?

239
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,649
I'm disabled.

240
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,606
- So, someone stole your...
- My wheelchair.

241
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,722
I... I'm disabled.

242
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,481
- Some lazy bastard just waltzed in there.
- Can you describe him?

243
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,400
- It was all over so quickly.
- Well, just tell us what you can.

244
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,249
Caucasian male.

245
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,368
Um... bearded.

246
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,451
Red hair.

247
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,608
Glasses.

248
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,449
Possibly a disguise. I...

249
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,530
All right, thank you.
Do you need any help getting home?

250
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,689
No, I'm fine. I'm with people.

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,007
Here they are now.

252
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,088
Hey, fellas.

253
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,080
- I'll take it from here.
- Nonsense. It's the least I can do.

254
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,447
OK.

255
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,447
- You slacking off in there?
- Um...

256
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,528
Go and get changed.

257
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,006
Excuse me, sir.
Can I have a word with you, please?

258
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,761
Amazing. So powerful. Thanks.

259
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,204
The... The grit of it.

260
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,402
Five stars.

261
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,807
- So what did you think?
- Of the musical?

262
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,922
Did you not just love it?

263
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,964
- Well, no. Sorry.
- Why not?

264
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,527
I don't know. It's just,
maybe you have to be...

265
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,085
gay.

266
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,808
- I loved it.
- I guess it's more of a... gay thing.

267
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,810
You know, you have to be gay.

268
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,002
A gay man.

269
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,569
- A homosexual.
- All I know is I loved every last second of it,

270
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,330
and I'm not...

271
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,240
usually a fan of musicals.
Hey, do you wanna meet the cast?

272
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,922
- Come on.
- The thing is, I have to meet Moss and Roy.

273
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,889
Hey, listen.
I told the cast about what happened,

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,049
and they told me
to get you all to come back and meet them.

275
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,969
Yeah!

276
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,289
Come on, everybody, off the van.

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,287
Hey, James!

278
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,209
Oh, wow, Edgar.

279
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,004
Hi.

280
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,930
Oh, brilliant.

281
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,769
Jeremy!

282
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,601
How do you know all these...
young, good-looking men?

283
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,961
Oh, you know, just from around.

284
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,606
Hey, Jerome. Come here, you.

285
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,167
- Great show.
- Hello, darling.

286
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,683
Can't talk at the mo. Got a disabled group
coming in for a chat. Here they are now.

287
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,130
He's had quite an evening.
Someone stole his wheelchair.

288
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,844
Really?

289
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,611
Did you see who it was?

290
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,087
- Red-bearded man.
- Uh-huh.

291
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,845
How long have you been disabled?

292
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,486
- Ten years.
- Ten years.

293
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,889
And how did it happen,
if that's not a rude question?

294
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,321
Acid.

295
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,760
What are the chances of that happening?

296
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,247
Ooh, a hundred to one.

297
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,689
- You look like you could do with a drink.
- Whisky, please. Double.

298
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,610
- Excuse me.
- Yes, Miss?

299
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,364
OK.

300
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,962
Can I have a double whisky, please?

301
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,606
- Double whisky.
- And a glass of white wine.

302
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,530
- Glass of white wine.
- Thank you.

303
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,086
You're very welcome, madam.

304
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,085
- Hello.
- Hello, Laura Knightly.

305
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,568
- How are you?
- I'm disabled.

306
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,321
It must be so difficult
being gay and disabled.

307
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,444
It's very difficult.

308
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,369
Yeah.

309
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,563
Oh, come here, my little soldier.

310
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,048
- Oh, what's the matter?
- I don't know.

311
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,651
- You're from telly.
- I am.

312
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,731
And do you know, a little birdie told me
that you couldn't make the show tonight.

313
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,241
So I've got you two tickets for tomorrow.

314
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,804
Brilliant.

315
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,410
- You're doing so well.
- Yeah.

316
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,568
- High-five.
- High-five.

317
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,608
Laura, couple of photos?

318
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,130
- Is he from the newspaper?
- Yes, he's from the <i>Standard.</i>

319
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,322
Oh, good.

320
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,244
What...? What's...?

321
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,011
I... I get it. Very funny.

322
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,804
You Irish!

323
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,608
Oh, I'm a bit tired. Can I have a
wheelchair too? Ha-ha! Hilarious!

324
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,485
Oh, me ligs don't work.

325
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,002
Help, help! I need a wheelchair.
Come on, get up.

326
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,567
Come on, stop mucking around.
I want a go.

327
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,163
Oh!

328
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,647
And then it goes like that...

329
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,610
Well, uh, I guess this is good night.

330
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,688
Yeah.

331
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,207
Oh, for God's sake! Are you gay?
Are you a gay man?

332
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,321
- No!
- Are you?

333
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,204
- No!
- No, brilliant, good.

334
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,767
Cos that's all I wanted to know.
I don't mind one way or another.

335
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,329
It's just, I like being clear.
I don't want any... ambiguity.

336
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,284
What on earth made you think I was gay?

337
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,450
Well... Well, you know,
I didn't just pull it out of the air.

338
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,406
You know, you've just brought me
to a gay musical called <i>Gay!.</i>

339
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,205
You've been laughing like mad
at every gay reference.

340
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,201
Your friends... all of who are gay,
say hello by tickling you.

341
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,767
Jen! What century are you living in?

342
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,521
Do you think that a man has to be gay
to like a gay musical?

343
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,849
Can a straight man
not have homosexual friends?

344
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,521
And since when was tickling gay?
I missed that meeting.

345
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,484
Jen. Jen, come here.

346
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,843
I'm sorry. You just threw me
when you borrowed that copy of <i>Heat.</i>

347
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,522
Oh, God, it's true, it's true.
I'm gay! I'm a gay man.

348
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,964
I tried to run from it, to deny it,
but I can't, I can't, I can't!

349
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,845
Oh, Jen, what am I gonna do?

350
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,083
I thought I could make it work between us
because you looked a bit like a man.

351
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,567
Oh, God!

352
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,601
Taxi!

353
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,963
Hello there.

354
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,447
I didn't see <i>you on</i> the way out.

355
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,211
All right, lads, let's
get a singsong going.

356
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,529
It's a long way back to Manchester.

357
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,849
♪ Willies, willies, I love willies

358
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,248
♪ Willies, willies, I love willies

359
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,448
- Good night, Steve.
- Good night, Moss.

360
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,610
- Good night, Milly. You be good.
- Not if I can help it.

361
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,808
The theatre!
