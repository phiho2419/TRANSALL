1
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,324
- Is this your stapler, Roy?
- No.

2
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,444
- No, it's not.
- I used it for one thing.

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,723
- How many staples did you use?
- 6 or 7.

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,761
1, 2, 3, 4... Is that 5?
..6... Is that 7?

5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,168
- Why do you need to know?
- I just do. I need to know.

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,330
You know I need to know, and you never
count how many staples you've used.

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,323
8, 9... Better do it in fives.
5, 10, 15...

8
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,011
- Is that 20?
- There you go, Moss.

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,806
Awright, Harry?
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,003
What was Wenger thinking,
sending Walcott on that early?

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,600
Thing about Arsenal,
they always try and walk it in.

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,691
- That is true. See you later, Moss.
- Mind how you go.

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,844
- What was that?
- What?

14
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,725
You were saying football things,
in a football voice!

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,162
Oh, it's this new site.
It sends you a list of football phrases

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,841
that you can use in normal conversation,
updated daily. It's great.

17
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,042
I only use it
so I can talk to the postman.

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,405
It's got a pronunciation guide -
or  pronunciation guide.

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,127
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,004
You can get it sent to your phone,

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,047
so that even when I'm away from my desk I
can still sound like I'm just a big, normal man.

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,083
45, 50...

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,407
Hey, Moss,
send me a link for that, will you?

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,249
Right, I'm off.

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,203
- Bit early.
- Got a date.

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,641
- Oh, right, with Michael?
- That's right.

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,048
- The guy who looks like a magician!
- Yeah.

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,122
- What?
- What?

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,322
What did you say?
He looks like a what?

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,764
- Michael, the guy that came in last week?
- He doesn't look like a magician.

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,370
Yeah, he does.

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,084
- Doesn't he, Moss?
- Hm?

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,525
- The guy that came in for Jen last week?
- Ah, Michael the Magnificent.

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,530
- He doesn't look like a magician.
- He does.

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,688
- He doesn't.
- He massively does.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,690
- He does, Jen.
- Oh, shut up.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,964
- It's a lovely restaurant.
- Isn't it? It's one of my favourites, actually.

38
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,811
One of the silly things
I love about this restaurant,

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,367
have you had a look at these
salt and pepper pots? They're beautiful.

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,601
There's something about them, the shape...
I'm a bit of a design freak, but it's beautiful...

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,329
What are they saying
that could possibly be that funny?

42
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,047
I'm funny. Why can't I be over there
making them laugh?

43
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,208
They're... proper men, Roy.

44
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,165
We're men. We're proper men.
What's so different about us?

45
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,529
7, 14, 21,

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,211
35, 42,

47
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,330
49...

48
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,130
35...  7...

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,802
Did you see
that ludicrous display last night?

50
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,762
21, 28...

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,686
Come... Referee... Aw...

52
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,204
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?

53
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,005
What's Wenger doing
sending Walcott on that early?

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,249
The thing about Arsenal
is they always try and walk it in.

55
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,045
- Exactly! Dan.
- Roy.

56
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,006
Chelsea, on the other hand,
I like them suddenly.

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,530
Yeah...

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,925
- Chelsea? You're having a laugh, in't ya?
- Whoa! I'll put money on it if you like.

59
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,362
Nah, I've got a pony on Liverpool,
so I probably won't see that again.

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,687
D'uh!

61
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,530
- Dan, Moss. Moss, Dan.
- Nice to meet you, son.

62
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,768
- You want a drink, boys?
- We'll get this.

63
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,247
Nah, it's on me.
Whatever these boys are 'aving.

64
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,521
- Here he is!
- Oi-oi!

65
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,768
- Oi-oi!
- Oi.

66
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,487
Roy, Moss, Derek, Luke.
Moss here fancies Liverpool for the weekend.

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,683
Liverpool? You're having a laugh, in't ya?

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,370
- He's put a pony on it!
- Pony?

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,767
Yeah! Tell Barry, tell Barry.

70
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,531
- Tell me what?
- He's only put a pony on Liverpool!

71
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,246
You lunatic, eh!

72
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,887
So who do you support?

73
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,727
- Who do I support?
- Yeah.

74
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,730
West Ham.

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,080
Did you say West Ham?

76
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,089
Is that all right?

77
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,524
All right?
What does that look like, a birthmark?

78
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,803
Did you see that?

79
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,168
My face!

80
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,567
Roy, can I have a natter with you?
It's about private man's business.

81
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,923
I'm sure you boys will understand.

82
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,771
Excuse me, please.

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,491
- I'm a little bit scared and I want to leave.
- What?

84
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,525
We're in too deep, Roy. I'm worried
they'll find out I don't know what a pony is.

85
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,802
- We should go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

86
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,685
I haven't paid for a drink all night,
and besides,

87
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,725
once you get over the football thing,
they're surprisingly easy to talk to.

88
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,444
Maybe we're proper men!

89
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,451
We're messing with stuff we don't understand.
We're through the looking glass.

90
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,040
Just promise me
you will not let this get too far.

91
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,764
I promise.

92
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,008
Hooray, he's kicked the ball.
Now the ball's over there.

93
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,765
That man has it now.
That's an interesting development.

94
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,686
Maybe he'll kick the ball.

95
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,521
He has indeed, and apparently
that deserves a round of applause.

96
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,564
- Shut up. They'll hear you.
- This is the worst thing in the world.

97
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,763
What could I do? He bought the tickets
when we were in the pub.

98
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,087
I could hardly say no, could I?

99
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,568
- Shall I use this?
- I don't know.

100
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,766
Look, they're singing!
Maybe we should sing.

101
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,486
Just promise
we won't do anything else with them.

102
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,365
I want to go back to being weird.
I like being weird.

103
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,086
Weird's all I've got -
that and my sweet style.

104
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,170
OK, look, we'll make our excuses
when the match is over.

105
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,126
- How long do football matches last?
- A billion hours, apparently.

106
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,165
- We're playing poker tonight. You game?
- I'm in.

107
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,930
Moss?

108
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,281
- I won't, Dan, no.
- Come on.

109
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,563
- No, no can do. I'm seeing a bird.
- Oh, really?

110
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,202
- Yeah, why not?
- What's she like?

111
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,927
Well, she's not much to look at,
but she is very kind-hearted,

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,566
so, as I say, I've got to vamoosh.

113
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,123
- What, you're not watching it?
- They're having a laugh today.

114
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,323
- They're winning.
- No, they're having a laugh.

115
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,403
Morning. Oh, my word.
When did the English start drinking like that?

116
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,730
- You people drink like you don't want to live!
- We do love to binge.

117
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,681
- What happened to you?
- I've got cockney neck.

118
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,691
I've been speaking too much cockney
and it's done my blooming neck in.

119
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,804
Oh, here she is, Debbie McGee.

120
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,805
Morning all. I'm off to break up with him.
What's wrong with you two?

121
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,611
- We've been hanging out with men.
- Why are you breaking up with him?

122
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,486
Why? What do you mean, why?
Because he looks like a magician.

123
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,285
- Doesn't he, though?
- Oh, he totally does.

124
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,290
And ever since you two said it
I can't get it out of my head.

125
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,688
So thanks, thanks a lot -
another one bites the dust.

126
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,091
- You're not dumping him because of that?
- I can't be seen with that mentalist.

127
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,569
Do you know what he does for a living?
He is a driving instructor.

128
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,810
A driving instructor who looks like a magician.
It's preposterous!

129
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,929
That's almost the worst look
a driving instructor could have.

130
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,930
- So distracting.
- Only a clown would be worse.

131
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,486
Mm. Or a mountie.

132
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,850
So, how was your night of poker
with the boys?

133
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,806
Yeah, good, good. I mean, I didn't...
I wasn't brilliant at the start,

134
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,241
because, you know, I was mostly vomiting.

135
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,361
Lovely.

136
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,487
But then I knuckled down and I brought
my A game, and, er... things got a lot better.

137
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,602
That's good.
How much did you win?

138
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,123
Er, no, no, I lost £200.
But it's less than I usually lose, so...

139
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,129
Still, £200, though.

140
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,923
Dan let me off.
He just totally let me off.

141
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,761
Proper men are so cool -
they just don't care about money.

142
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,444
- Hello?
- Where's my fucking money?!

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,607
- I want that money! Give me my money!
-  OK... Really?

144
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,246
I'm only joking, you muppet!

145
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,083
Oh, you're funny...

146
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,444
Roy, listen, a friend of mine's let me down
with something. Can you meet me at lunch?

147
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,449
Yeah, OK, OK...

148
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,210
I just went to the toilet.

149
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,846
OK, what's the address?

150
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,008
- Here he is.
- Hiya, Dan.

151
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,407
- You got here.
- Oi-oi, boys.

152
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,090
All right, mate?

153
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,646
- You all right?
- Yeah, er, pretty good.

154
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,923
- Hey, sorry again about last night.
- Nah, don't mention it.

155
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,806
Listen, that favour - you wouldn't be available
to do a little taxi job?

156
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,289
You want me to drive? This? Erm...
Yeah, yeah, I suppose so.

157
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,405
As I say, someone's let me down.
It should only take a couple of hours.

158
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,366
It's no problem. Oh, is it an automatic?
Cos I can only drive an automatic.

159
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,609
Oh, it is an automatic.

160
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,530
I'm your man.
You're sure everything with the money is OK?

161
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,405
Oh, yeah, yeah.
This makes us totally quits.

162
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,205
You, sir, are a gentleman.

163
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,123
This guy, huh?

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,401
Here we go.
Pull over here, Roy.

165
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,249
OK...

166
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,282
You have reached your destination.

167
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,041
- All right, everyone.
- Take your time.

168
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,365
Oh, wait, how do you get the radio to work?
Oh, no, no, it's OK, I've got it, I've got it.

169
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,482
Oh, I love this one.

170
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,728
Yeah?

171
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,763
- Hey, man.
- Hello.

172
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,441
- Hey, want to meet up after this?
- Yeah. Nothing's happening here.

173
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,691
The guys have this, er, lock-up
down by the gasworks on Newcombe Road.

174
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,043
The gasworks? Is there anything about them
that's not manly?

175
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,880
Jesus!

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,163
- Moss! Jesus Christ!
- What? What is it?

177
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,762
There's a robbery!
Across the road, right here!

178
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,124
There's a robbery!
Oh, some blokes in balaclavas...

179
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,720
Wow! They're totally robbing this place!

180
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,526
- Call the police, call the police!
- Yeah. Bye.

181
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,923
Police, please.

182
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,082
Yeah, hi, I'm on Denbury Road
and there is a robbery taking place right now.

183
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,001
Three men, indiscriminate race,
balaclavas, big guns.

184
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,651
Yeah, OK... Oh, my God,
they're coming out, they're coming out.

185
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,048
Yeah, OK, they're coming out...
They're running towards us...

186
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,606
They're running towards the car.
Oh, they're...

187
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,485
Drive!

188
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,522
Okie-dokie...

189
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,330
Oh, fuck...

190
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,124
- Straight ahead, Roy.
- OK.

191
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,288
Keep going, mate.

192
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,562
Right, swing a left here.

193
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,325
Right, drive up those ramps there.

194
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,091
Right, drive up the ramps into the truck.

195
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,771
- Come on, Roy, quickly!
- Yep, okie-doke.

196
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,167
- OK...
-  Come on!

197
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,250
Am I on it?
Am I on the track? I can't see.

198
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,601
Oh, no... Sorry, sorry, sorry.

199
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,644
What are you doing?!
Get on with it!

200
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,445
- Just get it up there!
- I don't fucking believe this!

201
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,087
Take two.
This is the one. OK...

202
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,728
Up, up, up, up we go, into the truck.

203
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,161
- What's that? Is someone crying?
-  No...

204
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,890
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?

205
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,407
What was Wenger thinking,
bringing Walcott on that early?

206
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,964
The thing about Arsenal
is they always try and walk it in.

207
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,245
But why? I don't understand.
I thought it was going so well.

208
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,842
- Was it something I did?
- No, no. It's hard to explain.

209
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,806
Tell me, Jen, for God's sake.
You owe me that much.

210
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,646
You look like a magician, Michael.

211
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,366
All right? I'm sorry, but you do.

212
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,926
I didn't notice at first,
but someone mentioned it

213
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,691
and now I can't get it out of my head.
It's driving me mad.

214
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,928
- But I'm not a magician.
- I know.

215
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,486
That's why it's not good
that you look like one.

216
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,570
Well, what is it, exactly, about me?

217
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,569
It's everything.

218
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,651
There's nothing about you that
doesn't look like a magician. It's everything.

219
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,207
Don't you see it? Don't you wake up
every morning and look in the mirror

220
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,926
and think,
"Jesus Christ, I look like a magician"?

221
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,805
- No.
- Well, you should.

222
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,050
I would,
if I was a weirdy-beardy magiciany man.

223
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,089
- I'm just trying to help you, Michael.
- So it's over because of that?

224
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,445
I don't see any way past it.
It's weird. It's weird for me.

225
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,686
- I'm sorry.
- No, wait.

226
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,201
Maybe we can think of something.

227
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,961
What if I actually learned some magic tricks?

228
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,482
- What do you mean?
- Well, perhaps if I learned some tricks,

229
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,683
it wouldn't feel so strange
that I look like a magician.

230
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,610
You'd have to learn a lot of tricks.

231
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,850
I mean, you'd basically
have to actually become a magician.

232
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,884
Do you really want to make
that kind of commitment?

233
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,168
We was stitched up.
They knew we were there.

234
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,443
Shut up. It was always a possibility.
That's why we had the truck.

235
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,168
We were barely out of there before the Bill
turned up. Someone grassed us up.

236
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,887
Oh, is that the...? I have to go.
I don't want to miss Gok's Fashion Fix.

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,288
You're too quick to trust people.
What do we know about this bloke?

238
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,325
- How do we know he didn't make a call?
- He didn't know about it till this afternoon.

239
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,965
I didn't know about it.

240
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,560
That's why I chose him
after you shot Derek.

241
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,401
That's why he chose me
after you shot Derek.

242
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,966
Hello!

243
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,209
Hiya.

244
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,564
- You remember Moss.
- So, tell me all about the big robbery.

245
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,321
What?

246
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,207
Roy saw a robbery. Did you phone the police
like you said you would?

247
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,803
I didn't say that.
I said I was listening to The Police.

248
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,322
Look at all that money.
I wonder how much is there.

249
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,851
1, 2, 3, 4...

250
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,045
You and your bloody great ideas.
I mean, who's this bloke?

251
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,642
All we know about him
is he supports West Ham.

252
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,607
- Or maybe that's a lie, too.
- Hey! Hey now, little man!

253
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,603
You can stand there
and slag me off all you like,

254
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,044
but don't you start talking about how I feel
about my beloved West Ham,

255
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,003
because I love 'em.

256
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,681
- I love them Gooners!
- That's bloody Arsenal.

257
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,690
You got a problem with him,
you got a problem with me.

258
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,124
- You're fucking right I've got a problem!
- Excuse me, I am trying to concentrate!

259
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,370
And will you watch your ruddy language?
My ears are not a toilet.

260
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,246
Derek was right about you.
What are you after? My piece of the action?

261
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,011
- Wanna end up in the boot with Derek?
- You wanna make one?

262
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,805
- I'll make one, mate. Right now.
- Let's have it, then.

263
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,960
- Don't you mug yourself. Don't mug yourself!
- Let's have it! Do it!

264
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,850
- I need to know how much is there.
- No, you don't.

265
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,328
We need to get out of here, OK?
We do not want to get mixed up in this.

266
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,488
Oh, f...

267
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,684
- What are we gonna do now?
- Quick!

268
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,645
Get out of the way, you bloody poofs!

269
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,648
OK, let's go.

270
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,568
Couldn't we have just
have hidden behind those bins?

271
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,248
I suppose.

272
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,842
Right, let's go.

273
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,930
So, er, if you just place these
back into the pack...

274
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,125
Just pop it back in, that's it.
Sorry... I'm a bit nervous.

275
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,451
And, erm, before your very eyes I shall do
the magic shuffle and... Ignore that.

276
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,045
...this will go in here and Bob's your uncle,
abracadabra, is this your card?

277
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,369
No, Michael.

278
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,487
I'm sorry, Michael, it's over.

279
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,965
I'd better make sure she's all right.

280
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,770
- Anyone see the final last night, then?
- Fuck off, Harry!

281
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,646
50, 100, 150, 200,

282
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,491
250, 300, 350, 400,

283
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,604
450, 500, 550, 600...

284
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,602
I think my dentist lives near here.
Do you know him?

285
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,527
That's a stupid question. Why would you
know him? It's not like you live in the truck.

286
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,482
So what sort of truck is this?
Are there different sorts of trucks?

287
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,170
Is that a stupid question?

288
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,922
Listen to me
chatting away like Stephen bloody Fry!

289
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,810
Who closed the door?
