1
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,929
Oh... Here we are.

2
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,327
Your place. Your place.

3
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,762
<i>La Maison de la femme.</i>

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>El casa delseñorita.</i>

5
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,325
<i>Das Haus die Frau.</i>

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,407
- Good night.
- Uh...

7
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,366
- I... You know, I'll just walk you to the door.
- There's no need. It's fine.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,131
I can get there on my own.

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,683
So... I guess this is <i>arrivederci</i>

10
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,645
Quite fancy a cup of tea, though.

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,887
Glass of water, maybe?

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,321
- Perhaps a little lie-down.
- Look...

13
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,886
I have to tell you something.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,322
- What?
- I wanted to say it in the restaurant, but...

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,603
a good time never came up,
and I wasn't going to say it,

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,563
- but...
- Say it.

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,648
I have to.

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,845
- What?
- You've got shit on your head.

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,763
What?

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,965
- There's some shit on your head.
- What?! Where?

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,481
- Where?
- It's... It's been there for ages.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,125
Oh, God.

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,522
Oh, God.

24
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,921
It's chocolate! It's chocolate.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,328
It's not shit.
It's not shit. It's, um...

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,081
It's my dessert. I don't know
how it got there, but, um...

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,443
It's on my fingers.
It's not shit.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,288
Thank God for that.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,290
D'you know, I've just spent the last hour

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,085
thinking you were
some sort of disgusting tramp.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,362
Oh, no!

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,488
That's funny.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,488
Oh! Look! It's...

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,171
It's... it's not.
It's chocolate.

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,531
Oh! How about that cup of tea now?

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,771
I was a perfect gentleman last night
from beginning to end,

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,884
but she can't see past
a little bit of shit on my forehead.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,129
- I thought you said it was chocolate.
- Yes, chocolate. I meant chocolate.

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,449
I forgot to turn this thing on.

40
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,568
<i>Hello, IT.</i>

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,967
<i>Something's wrong with my computer.</i>

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,606
<i>Have you tried
turning it off and on again?</i>

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,563
<i>Uh, no. I'll do that Thanks.</i>

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,205
<i>You're welcome, mate.</i>

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,805
It's typical. The one time I manage
to bamboozle a girl in the building

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,651
into going out with me, and this happens.

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,526
- Oh, she's going to tell everyone.
- Oh, come on. She's a receptionist.

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,282
She'd hardly gossip.
And besides, it's a boring story.

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,927
Yeah. Yeah, it's boring.
It's boring. She won't tell anyone.

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,048
Hello.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,811
Sorry.

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,204
She might have told Jen.

53
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,809
No! No, that's what I'm saying.
It wasn't. It was...

54
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,526
It <i>was</i> chocolate.
It was chocolate.

55
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,326
I don't know. I don't know. It got
on my fingers, and then it must have...

56
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,684
No... Listen!
How did you even hear about this, Mum?

57
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,771
Moss. Moss, there's a spider in my office.
Could you deal with it? I just hate spiders.

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,568
Oh. Ah. Yeah.

59
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,321
I'm not overly fond of
them myself there, Jen.

60
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,922
Um, how... how...

61
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,690
How big is...?

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,121
Whoa! Hey, now.

63
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,165
I tell you what. I'd actually
recommend my good friend Roy there

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,604
as the go-to guy on anything
with more than seven eyes.

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,805
- Um... He's on a very brief personal call...
- Come on, Moss. Don't be silly.

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,651
You're right, I'm being silly.
Wrap it up, Roy!

67
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,730
No, it's just a spider.
It's fine. It's just a spider.

68
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,491
Oh, look. It seems to have left
of its own volition.

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,288
- Oh, be a man, Moss.
- You're right. I'll be a man. I'm a man.

70
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,288
Please don't shut the door.

71
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,966
- I won't.
- Goodbye, Jen.

72
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,564
That was my mother.
How did she hear about it?

73
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,163
Oh, was that the woman who phoned earlier?
Cos I've just been telling everybody.

74
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,090
Why would you want
to go out with Patricia, anyway?

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,443
I mean, her last boyfriend
was Simon, from third.

76
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,449
- Jen?
- Hiya.

77
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,530
- Hello, there.
- Have you caught it yet?

78
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,608
Not quite, Jen.

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,965
The spider's managed to walk behind me,
and it's between me and the door.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,571
So I can't get out.

81
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,490
Simon from third is the one with the hair.

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,887
Oh, him! Oh, he's awful.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,368
He once ate a copy of <i>Loaded for</i> a bet.

84
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,201
- She liked <i>him?</i>
- Apparently.

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,962
That explains everything. She likes the
kind of big obnoxious guy who eats <i>Loaded</i>

86
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,845
Oh!

87
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,247
Hello, Daniel. How are you?

88
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,091
- I'm great, thanks. How are you?
- I'm great.

89
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,843
Well, can either of you tell me, OK,
uh, OK, who wrote <i>Missa Brevis</i> in D minor?

90
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,611
Was it Mozart or Beethoven?

91
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,122
That was a certain Mr Mozart,
I think you'll find.

92
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,527
Oh, right.
Do you know a lot about classical music?

93
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,291
- <i>Un petit pois.</i>
- Oh. Right.

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,802
- Thanks.
- Mozart, Beethoven. Fifty-fifty, isn't it?

95
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,730
- See what I mean?
- Hey! Actually, no, you were right.

96
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,730
It was... it was Mozart. It was... OK.

97
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,889
So, let's try another one.
Um... OK, here we are.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,881
In what year did Mozart die?
Was it 1780 or 1791?

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,685
- '91.
- Yes. Yes! Bang on.

100
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,290
Wow.

101
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,721
God, I hope he doesn't come in again.

102
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,489
- Jen?
- Yes?

103
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,446
Is Roy off the phone yet?
The spider is now upon my person.

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,370
You guys don't mind me
chilling out in here, do you?

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,484
No. Chill out.

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,171
Did you see the match last night?

107
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,044
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,047
- God!
- Did we?

109
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,130
- Wow! What a match!
- Yeah.

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,165
- All of the players running up the pitch...
- Players.

111
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,521
- Running.
- ..and running down it again.

112
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,486
- Such athleticism!
- What was Rooney thinking of, though?

113
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,968
Oh! Who knows? That's Rooney!

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,766
He is a foolish boy.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,043
Yeah, but that referee...
I'm sorry, the referee is just an idiot.

116
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,609
Yes. He was certainly
the villain of the piece.

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,850
- Oh! Daniel. You're still here.
- Yeah, just, uh, having a little break.

118
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,611
Do you, uh...
do you want to come and join me?

119
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,405
Oh, stop it!

120
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,043
Well, I'd better...

121
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,523
By the way, guys. If you need any help with any
more spiders, just, uh, give me a call, OK?

122
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,642
Yeah. We'll be fine, I think. Thanks.

123
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,491
Actually, do you have a card?

124
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,967
That's good. See you.

125
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,611
You like him.

126
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,440
Who? Oh, that good-looking man with
"Security" written on his shoulder.

127
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,642
Yes! Yes, I do.

128
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,491
- He seems really nice.
- Nice!

129
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,921
Oh, yeah. Cos that's what you women want.
Nice guys.

130
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,168
<i>Hello, IT.</i>

131
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,205
- What are you talking about, Roy?
- If my date last night proved anything,

132
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,689
- it's that you "ladies" don't want nice guys.
- If your date proved anything, Roy,

133
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,600
it's that women like men
without pooh on their foreheads.

134
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,802
That's our "type".

135
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,448
That had nothing to do with it. She clearly
just didn't want a gentleman in her life.

136
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,726
I hate to generalise, you know that,
but all women just want bastards!

137
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,562
Oh! That "women liking bastards" thing
is a total myth.

138
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,162
<i>I've tried turning it off and on again,
and nothing happens.</i>

139
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,046
<i>- Is it definitely plugged in?
- Let me have a look.</i>

140
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,562
<i>- Oh, sorry. That's it. Thanks very much.
- You're welcome, mate.</i>

141
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,082
It's just not true.

142
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,171
Women don't want gentlemen,
they want bullies and thugs.

143
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,568
- I'll prove it to you.
- How will you prove it to me, Roy?

144
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,641
Oh! OK. I'll put, uh...
I'll put a classified ad online.

145
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,411
- A classified?
- Yeah, like a "lonely hearts" thing.

146
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,127
But I'll make it sound psychotic.
And I still bet I get a bezillion replies.

147
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,129
- Oh, dear God.
- Come on. How much?

148
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,531
OK. Yeah. I'll give you 20 quid
if you get one response.

149
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,530
- You're on.
- Oh, my God, no.

150
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,531
It's... it's all about
body fluids with you, isn't it?

151
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,011
- Come on, Moss. We need to get to work.
- Work?

152
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,523
We need to post a classified lonely hearts
ad online that makes me sound like a psycho,

153
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,690
so that I can prove to Jen that all women
love bastards and therefore win £20.

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,247
Oh, thank God.
I thought that thing was broken.

155
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,405
"Shut up. Do what I tell you.
I'm not interested."

156
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,447
"These are just some of the things
you'll be hearing if you answer this ad."

157
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,690
"I'm an idiot, and I don't care
about anyone but myself."

158
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,167
"PS, no dogs."

159
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,368
- That's good.
- What's yours?

160
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,566
- Mine doesn't look any good now.
- Go on.

161
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,967
"I'm going to murder you...

162
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,281
you bloody woman."

163
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,845
Might want to play a bit hard to get.

164
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,681
If you were a murderer,
what would your nickname be?

165
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,647
Mine would be "The Gardener", cos I'd
always leave a rose at the scene of the crime.

166
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,922
What would your murder weapon be?

167
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,366
A hammer.

168
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,529
Hey, Moss.

169
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,602
Would you like to go for dinner with me?

170
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,849
And then maybe back to my place.

171
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,521
I'd love to, Jen,
but I'm actually helping Roy at the moment.

172
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,645
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Who does this remind you of, yeah?

173
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,650
Do you wanna go on a date with me?

174
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,646
Gandhi?

175
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,481
No, no. No, the other one. Bono.

176
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,568
- No. No, no, no. I was doing Roy.
- Oh, yes, yes. It's like there was two of me.

177
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,570
Come on, get your money ready.
Twenty pounds.

178
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,126
- Sorry, Jen, do you...?
- Hey. Hello.

179
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,687
It's Security.

180
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,928
I hope I'm not in any danger.

181
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,644
Oh, my God.

182
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,728
It's not shit.

183
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,488
On my head, it's not shit.
It's chocolate spread.

184
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,921
- Taste it. Look.
- No!

185
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,601
Oh! No. No, that is...
Oh! That's... Oh, God!

186
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,648
Ringo Starr?

187
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,160
I'll be wondering about that all night.

188
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,001
- How do you know about this site?
- Oh, I'm a member.

189
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,442
Really? You do
the whole "lonely hearts" thing?

190
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,645
I'm a 32-year-old IT man
who works in a basement.

191
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,206
Yes, I do the whole
"lonely hearts" thing.

192
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,921
So, as you can clearly see,
it wasn't...

193
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,170
excrement, it was chocolate.
I was playing a joke. It was chocolate.

194
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,965
Jen, it's OK. I've got it.
Don't worry about it.

195
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,606
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

196
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,687
- I got a response!
- Oh, that was quick.

197
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,167
Yeah. Why's it taking so long to download?

198
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,763
Oh, something happened with the routers this
morning. We're back to pre-broadband speed.

199
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,848
"Dear..."

200
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,164
But we're on the phone now.
Why can't you just ask me now?

201
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,362
I can't, Jen. Trust me.

202
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,484
- Why should I trust you?
- Because I know what's good for you.

203
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,291
Listen, you have to be home between eight
and nine tonight. Are you gonna be home?

204
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,448
OK. This sounds exciting.

205
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,086
Look, it might not happen, OK?
But hopefully it will.

206
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,683
- I don't know if this is exciting or not.
- Jen... Jen, it's exciting.

207
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,570
"Would be very interested in meeting up
and talking it over. Love, Rebecca."

208
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,207
- Oh, my God. What did we write again?
- It started with "Shut up."

209
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,560
Ooh!

210
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,767
Oh, there's more. "I attach a photograph for
your approval. Or not!" Exclamation mark.

211
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,884
All right.
Let's have a look at you, you mad thing.

212
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,129
Nice hair so far.

213
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,288
Eyebrows seem normal.

214
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,323
Two eyes.

215
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,444
That's the best amount of eyes.

216
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,369
Nice eyes, too.

217
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,609
It has to go wrong.
She must have a shite nose.

218
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,723
Come on. Oh, do you remember
the internet at this speed?

219
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,730
Up all night, and you'd see eight women.

220
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,007
- Good nose.
- That <i>is</i> a good nose.

221
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,966
The mouth has to be wrong. There's gotta be
something wrong with the mouth.

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,765
Now, that's a good-looking woman.

223
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,281
Shall I tell Jen we got a reply?

224
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,209
Roy?

225
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,726
Roy?

226
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,928
Roy?

227
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,329
Roy?

228
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,890
Hello, Daniel? I mean, hello?

229
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,245
<i>Jen? Uh, hello. It's Chris Tarranthere,
from "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"</i>

230
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,728
- Oh, my God! Chris Tarrant!
- Hello!

231
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,127
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

232
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,527
<i>The next voice you'll hear
is going to be Daniel's,</i>

233
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,770
<i>but before I put you on with him,
he's asked me to ask you a question.</i>

234
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,484
OK. You can ask me a question.

235
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,401
<i>Yeah. He wants to know if you'll go out
for dinner with him tomorrow night</i>

236
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,161
No, really?
Yes! Yes, of course I will!

237
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,762
Of course I will! Yes! Yes, of course!

238
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,202
<i>Yes, that's great Jen. Right now
let me fill you in on what's happening.</i>

239
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,644
<i>Daniel's doing very well, although he has
just used his "50-50". Now, here's Daniel.</i>

240
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,481
<i>Daniel, you've got30 seconds,
starting from... now.</i>

241
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,170
<i>- OK.</i>
- Hello, Daniel.

242
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,762
<i>Yeah, hi, Jen.
OK, who composed "The Wooden Prince"?</i>

243
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,089
<i>(Was it A) Bartók, B) Chopin?</i>

244
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,207
Oh. Oh.

245
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,405
- Did you see <i>I'm a Millionaire</i> last night?
<i>- Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</i> it's called.

246
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,320
- No, I didn't.
- You are not going to Adam and believe this.

247
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,330
Um... OK, do these
make me look like a bastard?

248
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,569
- Why do you want to look like a bastard?
- I've got that date tonight.

249
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,365
She's expecting a monster.
Do these make me look like a bastard?

250
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,643
They make you look like an idiot?
Anyway, did you see it?

251
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,411
- What?
- <i>Do You Want To Be A Millionaire?</i>

252
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,524
<i>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</i>

253
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,884
Ah! Who wants to be
a person who is <i>wrong?</i>

254
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,082
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's happened?

255
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,690
- If I may?
- Sure.

256
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,770
- Guess who was on it last night.
- You?!

257
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,962
No. Daniel, king of men.

258
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,811
- Daniel was on <i>Millionaire?!</i>
- Indeed he was, sir.

259
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,207
And it was
the "Do You Want To Phone A Friend?"...

260
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,924
<i>- </i> "Phone A Friend".
- Anyway.

261
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,771
- She was the "Phone A Friend"?
- She was the "Phone A Friend".

262
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,009
You were the "Phone A Friend".
Oh! What was the subject?

263
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,442
"Classical music" is
the extraordinary answer to that question.

264
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,406
So who, of course, is Daniel, our esteemed
temp security guard going to phone

265
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,364
but Jonathan Miller over here?

266
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,882
Daniel was on <i>Millionaire.</i>
Too bad it wasn't "50-50".

267
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,886
- It was.
- And?

268
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,650
- I got it wrong.
- Oh!

269
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,525
I cost him £31,000.

270
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,484
It isn't funny, though.
Now I have to go on a date with him.

271
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,126
Wow. The rules on that show
have really changed.

272
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,242
No, you don't understand.

273
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,524
He asked me out on the show
before I got the question wrong.

274
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,884
It was all very romantic, but now...

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,162
I don't think he likes me now!

276
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,851
And I don't want to go out
with the biggest loser in England!

277
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,691
There you are, Daniel.

278
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,166
- Hello.
- Hiya.

279
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,451
- We gonna go for this meal, then?
- Yeah.

280
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,451
Yeah, I can't wait. I'm going to take you
to one of my favourite restaurants.

281
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,528
Right.

282
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,483
I'll pay.
It really is the least I can do.

283
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,682
Oh, my God.
Did you see that look?

284
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,849
I have a dinner date with that man.

285
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,850
If I'm not here tomorrow,
I want you to call the police.

286
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,725
Maybe not the best time to mention it,
but also you owe me 20 quid.

287
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,446
What? You got a response?

288
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,404
- For the one that ended "No dogs"?
- Yup.

289
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,650
- Oh, my God. Brilliant. More money gone.
- The money Daniel lost wasn't really yours.

290
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,051
It would have been if I'd married him,
Moss. OK, I need a good restaurant.

291
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,721
Maybe if he likes the food
he won't beat me to death with a shoe.

292
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,401
I thought you said you were taking him
to one of your favourite restaurants.

293
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,569
Haven't you got it yet?
That's what I do.

294
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,524
I lie, I lie, and I lie,

295
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,041
<i>and I</i> lie!

296
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,051
Well, I went to a good place recently.
Nice atmosphere. Food's great.

297
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,640
- Really?
- Yes. What?

298
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,127
Sorry, I just didn't have you down
as a restaurant person.

299
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,971
I'm a restaurant person.
Why wouldn't I be a restaurant person?

300
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,844
Cheese string?

301
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,361
No, thanks.
What's this place called?

302
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,642
- Mesijos.
- Is that French?

303
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,569
French? No, it's English.

304
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,890
Oh. OK. Thank you, Moss.
Yeah, I'll give that a go.

305
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,564
OK, I need a place to bring this girl
that says "I'm a bastard".

306
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,651
Well, I went to a good place recently.
Nice atmosphere. Food's great.

307
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,888
- It's got a bit of an edge.
- Yeah? What's it called?

308
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,241
- Mesijos.
- What is that? Spanish?

309
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,727
No. Spanish? It's English.

310
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,808
Mesijos.

311
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,211
Wa-hey! Okey-dokey.
You get the firecracker nachos.

312
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,166
And you get the prawn bites
with spicy salsa.

313
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,802
This, uh, seems an unusual place
for someone like you to want to meet.

314
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,084
Yeah, well...
Everyone needs a place to come to be alone.

315
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,329
Look at me, look at me!
Yeah! Look at me!

316
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,047
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah. Nah-nah,
nah-nah-nah. Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah.

317
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,731
Can we get a clown over here, please?!

318
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,207
- You're a loner?
- I'm a loner all right.

319
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,688
I'm just a...

320
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,121
lonely loner...

321
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,971
on a lonely road.

322
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,130
Alone.

323
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,649
- Do you always wear shades?

If you're coming, can you just
bloody hurry up? For God's sake!

361

No, don't be stupid.
It's cold. Taxi!

365

- Here.
- Oh, God.

366

Night, then.

the toilet but I'm not using it.</i>

375

376
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,891

- Yes?</i>

377
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,243
<i>- What are you doing in there?
- Number twos. Leave me alone!</i>

378
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,807
<i>Don't forget to flush the toilet
Don't clog it up like you usually do.</i>

379
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,163
<i>I know! Just stop doing this!
You're always doing this!</i>

380
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,726
<i>You're making it go back in!</i>
