1
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,168
So, how much are you asking for?

2
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,203
Oh, nothing,
just take whatever you want.

3
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,130
I just don't want to start cluttering up
the place with old stuff, you know.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,004
That's kind of what
this new place is all about.

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,009
I just want to totally reinvent myself.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,841
From this moment on,
everything is going to be different.

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,322
Hello, IT, have you tried
turning it off and on again?

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,770
I did it! I did it! I've been accepted!

9
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,370
- No!
- What's going on?

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,926
I've been accepted!
I applied and they said yes!

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,361
Who said yes?
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,209
Moss, you're shaking!

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,970
Consonant, please.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,845
- B.
- And a vowel, please.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,247
And lastly, A.

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,161
And here's the Countdown clock.

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,251
All right, let's see what we've got.
Jeremy?

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,407
Six.

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,329
- And Maurice?
- Nine.

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,490
- Jeremy, what's your six?
-"Tenant."

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,809
- And Maurice?
- It actually already is a word.

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,331
"Tnetennba."

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,686
Good heavens, really?
Could you use it in a sentence for us?

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,531
"Good morning. That's a nice tnetennba."

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,640
Someone reminded me earlier,
you haven't yet got a word

26
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,445
less than eight letters long.
It's quite extraordinary.

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,485
You really do look like you're on your
way to winning that Countdown teapot!

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,644
No offence, Jeremy.

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,686
Who are you?

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,529
- You want me to do your windows, mate?
- What?

31
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,802
- I'm working.
- What? I can't understand you.

32
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,922
- Right on, mate.
- No! No, no!

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,123
-- Stop cleaning my windows!

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,283
I want to go to the toilet.

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,845
I don't know what you're saying.

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,971
The window in front,
the window in back...

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,563
Yes, yes, yes. Okey dokey.
I can't understand what you're saying.

38
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,650
- Leave my bike for a few...
- Okay, then. All right. Bye-bye.

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,404
Okay. What are you doing?

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,325
-- Why are you bringing the bike inside?

41
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,886
What? No! Where are you going?

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,766
Where are you going?
Why do I have your bike?

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,170
And then, when he leaves, he just
leaves all of his stuff in my flat.

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,281
What stuff?

45
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,640
You know, all his
window-cleaning bollocks!

46
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,003
The ladder, the bike, everything.
It's still there!

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,248
- What, in your flat?
- Yeah, he never came back!

48
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,203
How did he even get in?

49
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,482
Well, he was very persuasive.

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,766
I think.

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,409
Well, I don't know how to get
in touch with this guy.

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,003
His stuff is cluttering up my hallway.
I've had to start putting these up.

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,563
My mum always says
you should never open the door.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,163
- What do you mean?
- An unopened door is a happy door.

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,170
So we never answer ours
when someone knocks.

56
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,091
- What, so you all just sit there?
- Yes.

57
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,922
So the doorbell goes
and you all just sit there

58
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,441
-until the person goes away?
- Yes.

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,483
What if it's important?
What if it's good news?

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,331
This is London, Jen.
It's not someone with cake.

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,444
Unless that cake is made
of dog poo and knives!

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,601
Laters. I'm going to zone out
at the Heads of Department meeting.

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,767
I thought you were
trying to avoid those.

64
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,771
There's only so many times I can say
there's a RAM emergency.

65
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,486
Hello?

66
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,247
Yes?

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,045
Hello. Can I come in?

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,571
- Why?
- What?

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,409
Why do you want to come in?

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,727
Isn't this the Heads
of Department meeting?

71
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,080
Every Monday and Friday?
Or has it changed?

72
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,964
No, no, yes, it is, yes, um...

73
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,048
You've missed a few though, haven't you?

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,688
Yeah, there was a RAM emergency.
The office had too much RAM.

75
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,963
Okay, well, you see, the nature of
the meetings has changed somewhat

76
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,721
and it wouldn't be fair on you.
There'd be a lot of catching up to do.

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,807
Okay.

78
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,570
Okay, thanks, Jen!

79
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,531
They don't want me!
They don't want me at the Monday-Friday!

80
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,881
I thought you hated those meetings.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,365
I did hate those meetings.

82
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,209
Until they didn't want me
at those meetings.

83
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,527
And now I love those meetings.

84
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,561
Five minutes, Mr Moss.

85
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,091
Thanks, Phil.

86
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,961
A fan of tiny biscuits.

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,728
You are full of surprises.

88
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,403
Please, don't let me stop you.

89
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,967
I like a man with appetite.
It's what got you this far.

90
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,001
Sorry, do I know you?

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,681
They call me Prime.
I had another name once.

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,969
I no longer go by it. Harold Tong.

93
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,328
That's right.
I won year 16 of Countdown.

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,607
Yes, it was I who won
the 16th Countdown teapot.

95
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,840
The teapot we all crave.
You crave it, too!

96
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,329
Your eyes betray you!

97
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,041
Uh-huh.

98
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,602
He has spirit, this one!

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,207
But do you have the spirit
to become an ultimate champion?

100
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,966
I wonder.

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,365
Do you want to get a photo together
or something?

102
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,642
I came only to give you this.

103
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,485
What is it?

104
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,447
Roy?

105
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,607
Jesus! Alistair, hey!

106
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,523
- Long time no see!
- Yeah.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,923
Uh, Roy and I were at college together.

108
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,123
Yeah. Wow, you are looking great!

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,446
Thanks.

110
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,891
So what are you up to these days?

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,650
What am I up to? Wow. Big question.

112
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,525
Um, I'm the head writer
for Shotgun games.

113
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,563
- Do you know them?
- Yeah!

114
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,403
Wow! Really?
I play Shotgun games all the time.

115
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,567
- They're brilliant.
- Oh, thank you.

116
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,651
Wow, that is so cool.
Hey, you just won an award, right?

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,841
Yes.

118
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,643
Well, see you soon, Roy.

119
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,921
Yes.

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,331
Don't ask me what I'm doing,
you arrogant twat.

121
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,643
Sorry, I'm not sure
I'm in the right place.

122
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,287
Oh, you're in the right place, Mr Moss.
Welcome to Eight Plus.

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,808
You came! I'm glad!

124
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,404
That's Roger Black
and that's Steven Pawlin.

125
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,244
You know your ex-Countdown winners!

126
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,725
Why are they all here?

127
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,047
Why, for someone who knows
how to add and subtract

128
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,403
and multiply and divide lots of numbers
to get one other number,

129
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,127
you're not so good at putting
two and two together, are you?

130
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,368
This is Eight Plus!

131
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,921
An exclusive club for those gifted few

132
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,044
who make it through
to eight episodes of Countdown.

133
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,811
And you are our newest member.

134
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,449
Oh, isn't that nice?

135
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,802
Thanks for letting me know, Linda.
All right. All right, bye.

136
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,770
Does it not outrage you, Roy,
as a member of this IT department,

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,805
that I, your head, is not being
represented at the Monday-Friday?

138
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,003
Couldn't give a shit.
My neighbour just called.

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,921
Turns out that window-washing Willy
from West Gibberish

140
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,522
is not now going to be able to pick up
his window-cleaning bric-a-brac.

141
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,607
Why not?

142
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,690
Oh, he was hit by a car or something.
It's just my luck!

143
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,121
You shouldn't have agreed
to mind it for him in the first place.

144
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,685
Oh, thanks, Jen. That's really helpful.

145
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,531
That's really good advice.
That's exactly what I'll do,

146
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,530
in the past, when it happens again,
last week.

147
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,565
I have to give it back to him!
It can't just live in my hallway!

148
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,484
Don't give a shit!

149
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,046
No, no. Oh, look, no!

150
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,523
No... Alistair!
I'm not a window cleaner!

151
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,080
I'm not a... Alistair!

152
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,048
Alistair! I'm not a window cleaner!

153
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,365
I'm not a window cleaner! Alistair!

154
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,924
I'm not a window cleaner!

155
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,481
All right, something weird
is going on in that room.

156
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,841
They're wearing dressing gowns.

157
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,849
Roy, will you listen to me?

158
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,123
I don't have to listen to you.
I'm not married to you.

159
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,004
I've got a lot on my mind
right now, Jen.

160
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,884
This bloke thinks I'm a window cleaner.

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,844
Bloke I went to college with,
he's doing amazingly.

162
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,371
The creature he was with!

163
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,245
And he thinks
that I am a window cleaner!

164
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,966
A window cleaner!

165
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,731
What's wrong with that?
It's a noble profession.

166
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,684
If your last profession
was cleaning balls!

167
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,409
- Google him.
- I've tried. He has no online presence.

168
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,411
Apparently, people were being rude
to him so he suspended all his accounts.

169
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,409
He's not on Friendface,
he's not on Chitter...

170
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,487
Listen...

171
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,125
How do people expect you
to track them down

172
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,129
if they maintain no online presence?

173
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,083
You have both asked
and answered that question.

174
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,440
What do you think is going on up there?

175
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,971
Is this Meeting Room 5?

176
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,082
You know, they soundproofed that
a few weeks ago?

177
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,168
Really? What's that all about?

178
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,726
Douglas said it was
for super-secret meetings.

179
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,922
But I want to go
to super-secret meetings!

180
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,327
I can't believe I might be missing
super-secret meetings!

181
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,046
But the dressing gowns!
Why are they wearing dressing gowns?

182
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,322
- Orgies.
- No!

183
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,729
Maybe they're getting some kind of
executive massage treatment

184
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,001
for being brilliant!

185
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,326
Do you think they're getting massages?

186
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,410
If they're getting massages, I think
my human rights are being abused

187
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,885
by them not letting me in.

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,367
Why don't you wear a towel,
hang around the door

189
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,447
and see if they let you in?

190
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,849
I have my dignity, thank you, Moss.
No. Hang on, that might just work!

191
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,206
Oh!

192
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,451
I can't believe you've joined
a swanky club. It's so showbizzy!

193
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,326
Roy, the people here see me
in a certain way.

194
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,967
It's perhaps not the way
I've been seen outside of the club.

195
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,007
I'd just like you not to, you know,
mention it in any way, or, you know...

196
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,610
Sure. Yeah. No problem.

197
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,680
Oh.

198
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,690
Hello, Terence.
Glass of milk. Straight up.

199
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,883
- Prime?
- Ribena for me.

200
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,287
Roy?

201
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,244
Uh, I'll have a beer. Thank you.

202
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,962
Alcohol-free beer, surely?

203
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,207
No.

204
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,727
- Get him what he wants.
- But...

205
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,888
Just get him what he wants.

206
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,881
I'll have to go out.
Can somebody mind the bar?

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,844
No, no. You know what? It's fine.
Um... I'll just...

208
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,927
I shouldn't really be drinking
during lunch.

209
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,441
- I'll just have a Coke.
- It's fine.

210
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,769
Will I see you tonight?

211
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,450
Not now, Ivana.

212
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,807
Did you have sex with that lady?

213
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,846
If you call that mindless,
animalistic rutting sex,

214
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,440
then yes, I suppose we did.

215
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,769
That sounds like sex.

216
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,841
Countdown groupies are the most
sexually voracious of all groupies.

217
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,849
And the most beautiful.

218
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,446
I hear someone likes drinking beer.

219
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,961
This is a private booth, Negative One.

220
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,570
The name!

221
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,442
This is a private club, Word.

222
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,364
Word! True dat! True dat, innit?

223
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,364
My name is Word here.

224
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,525
Roy, please.

225
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,486
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Negative One.

226
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,605
Heard you been catching
some nice letters.

227
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,201
I get the same letters as everyone else.

228
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,800
Good when they fall
in the right order, though, innit?

229
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,604
Steady, gentlemen.

230
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,647
Boom!

231
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,645
Don't mind him.

232
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,485
Negative One was quite proud
of being our best speller

233
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,443
until Moss came along.

234
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,050
Ah! Our drinks.

235
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,728
Can I just say,
I am having a great time.

236
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,321
Hey, yo, turn the music off!
Turn the music off!

237
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,843
Uh-oh, what's he up to?

238
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,767
Maybe our new champion would like
to test his skills out on the street.

239
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,281
He's challenging you
to a game of Street Countdown!

240
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,006
You cannot accept. It's too dangerous.

241
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,001
Well, what do you say?

242
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,161
Or is you worried you is going to show
yourself up in front of your girlfriend?

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,002
He's calling Roy your girlfriend.

244
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,567
Within the walls of Eight Plus,
that's a definite dis.

245
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,125
You're lucky my "girlfriend"
has gone to the toilet.

246
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,923
Is you gonna answer me or what?

247
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,850
No! We promised those days were over!

248
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,050
No more unlicensed
Street Countdown battles!

249
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,641
I didn't "aks" you. I "aksed" him.

250
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,641
Well?

251
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,801
What is Street Countdown?

252
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,729
It's more or less the same
as normal Countdown,

253
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,127
except we play it on the street.

254
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,289
Doesn't sound that dangerous.

255
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,209
It can get quite cold.

256
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,927
- I always wear thermals.
- Ah, then you're probably fine.

257
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,603
Hey, I is still standing here.
What do you say, newbie?

258
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,687
I came here to drink milk and kick ass.

259
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,081
And I've just finished my milk.

260
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,686
Welcome to Street Countdown!

261
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,926
Ooh!

262
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,249
First rule of Street Countdown

263
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,728
is that you really must try and tell
as many people as possible about it.

264
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,208
It's a rather fun game, and the more
people we tell about it, the better.

265
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,691
What the...

266
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,882
Where is everyone? Hello?

267
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,169
Hello? Moss?

268
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,606
Ivana?

269
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,686
Hello?

270
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,090
Hello in there!

271
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,490
Oh, for... Ooh.

272
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,122
Oh, hey! Hey, mate! Mate!

273
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,521
Um, could you do me a favour?

274
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,526
So, do you just do big windows
or do you do call-outs?

275
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,041
What, do you think I'm going to
come round and do your house?

276
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,403
No. No. Didn't think that.

277
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,129
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

278
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,490
Oh, hey!

279
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,361
Alistair! Alistair! It's me.

280
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,087
Alistair! I'm not a window cleaner!

281
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,201
What?

282
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,721
I'm not a window cleaner!

283
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,169
What? I've got to go!

284
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,047
I'm... I'm not a window cleaner!

285
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,082
Oh, that bloke,
he thinks I'm a bloody window cleaner!

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,684
Not that there's...

287
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,203
It's a noble profession.

288
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,162
Is this as fast as this goes?

289
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,886
Consonant.

290
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,126
Vowel.

291
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,845
Vowel. Boom!

292
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,524
I'll take a further consonant.

293
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,449
Consonant. You get me?

294
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,164
I'll take a vowel this time.

295
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,931
I'll have what he's having. Vowel.

296
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,408
I'll have another consonant.

297
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,167
Give me one of those sweet,
sweet consonants, you get me?

298
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,123
I'll take a consonant,
plain and simple, thank you.

299
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,527
I'll take an even sweeter vowel.

300
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,241
I'll take a regular vowel, please.

301
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,920
Yeah, I think... I think that's
probably enough letters, yeah?

302
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,524
Eighteen letters!
I've never seen so many.

303
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,325
He is the one.

304
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,451
- What happened to you...?
- Shh!

305
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,961
This is the longest word yet
on Street Countdown.

306
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,809
Unlike normal Countdown,
you see, what happens...

307
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,365
I don't care.

308
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,411
Negative One?

309
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,366
Twelve.

310
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,800
Ooh!

311
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,686
Moss?

312
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,287
Sixteen.

313
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,689
Your word, Negative One?

314
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,529
"Enormousness."

315
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,362
I shall give my answer, if I may,
in the form of a joke.

316
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,770
This is most irregular!

317
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,805
What do you call Negative One
sitting alone in an empty room?

318
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,484
I don't know. What do you call Negative
One sitting alone in an empty room?

319
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,204
"Overnumerousness!"

320
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,001
Gyles?

321
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,329
Yes, that is a word!
And the joke does make sense!

322
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,045
Okay, let's go!

323
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,645
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, shit.

324
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,369
Five, six, seven...
Ah, Jen, you've joined us!

325
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,970
Yes, yes, I have.

326
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,764
You're not really dressed for it.

327
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,281
Thought I'd wear normal clothes
and work up a real sweat.

328
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,802
Hardcore! And there's me thinking
you didn't have it in you.

329
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,720
Right, now let's take it to the max!
Five, six, seven, eight!

330
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,963
Hey! Hey, Alistair!

331
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,243
Oh, God, I can't believe I got you!
How you doing?

332
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,611
Yeah, no, it's Roy. Yeah, hello.

333
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,725
Listen, Alistair, I just wanted to say,
I'm not a window cleaner.

334
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,442
No, no, I work in IT!

335
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,808
Yeah, yeah, with computers and all that.

336
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,925
Macs? Uh, no,
I really just work with Windows.

337
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,206
Hello?
