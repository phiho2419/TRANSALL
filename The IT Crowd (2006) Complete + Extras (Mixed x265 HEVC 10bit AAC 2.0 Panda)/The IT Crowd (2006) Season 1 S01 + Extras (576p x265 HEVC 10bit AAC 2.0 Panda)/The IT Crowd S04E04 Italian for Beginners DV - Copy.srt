2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,844
I'm sorry, guys. I wish I could have
come here with better news.

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,564
But according to these projections,

4
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,650
Reynholm Industries
is in a critical position.

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,888
We took a major downturn last year.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,843
Like the rest of the economy.

7
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,611
And as a result,
we have estimated losses

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,246
at well over 400 million pounds.

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,682
Before we go on, Linda,
do you need to go to the toilet?

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,767
No.

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,645
Then why are you doing a wee-wee walk?

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,128
It's incredibly odd and distracting.
Maybe it's just me.

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,369
No, no, it's not just you, Douglas.
I'm also finding it very distracting.

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,086
- Sorry, Linda.
- Don't worry about it, Jen.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,770
It is not a wee-wee walk.

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,441
I am actually doing a round-the-world
virtual triathlon for charity,

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,961
using an iPhone application
and Google maps.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,124
Look, I'm in Spain.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,409
God, that's hugely impressive.

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,251
- Haven't you just had a baby?
- So they tell me.

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,809
Oh, for God's sake.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,483
Sorry,
did that sound like words?

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,369
No, do go on. And congratulations
on getting an iPhone.

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,971
I say we get in Silvio Bernatelli.

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,844
Bernatelli? The most successful
businessman of the year?

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,883
Why, a word from him
can make or break a business.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,970
Look, Reynholm Industries
is in a tough spot.

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,801
But with Bernatelli as an investor,
I think we can come out on top.

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,810
This is very convincing, Linda.
Damn good job.

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,685
Damn good, bloody good, damn good job.

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,044
You're the best woman here.
You are an excellent woman.

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,082
Linda, bloody Linda.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,522
"I'm so good at business things.
Reynholm Industries."

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,086
God, do you have any idea
how annoying this woman is?

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,850
I have an inkling.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,929
Ohh! I just had a eureka moment.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,925
Why do I keep my phone
in my trouser pocket?

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,408
It's too far,
but look at this, top pocket.

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,931
Yeah? Not as far. Yeah?

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,681
Yeah? Look at that.
See how smooth that is?

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,086
Ooh, mama!

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,885
Do you see that?
Do you wish you saw that?

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,204
- Sorry, did I interrupt?
- No.

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,802
She had a baby like yesterday
and she's already invading Spain.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,922
-- Linda just had a baby?

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,724
Wow, well, you'd never know.

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,842
-- What?

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,410
- Too much information.
- What, that she had a baby?

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,721
- Come on.
- Moss, it's a natural part of life.

50
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,128
It's not a natural part of my life
and I aim to keep it that way.

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,204
You should be okay.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,767
Oh, what's that jacket for?

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,164
It's not for anything.
It was a present. Julia got it for me.

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,282
Oh, how is Julia the orphan?

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,687
- Don't call her that.
- Why?

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,484
That's the first thing
you told us about her.

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,444
I totally think of her
as Julia the orphan.

58
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,846
Yeah, well, get out of the habit of it.

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,247
What if it slips out
when you meet her in person?

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,728
I'm hardly likely to say,
"Hello, Julia the orphan" to her, am I?

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,127
I totally would say that to her.

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,241
- Yeah, I know you would.
- But she's still an orphan, right?

63
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,361
Yes. Her parents haven't
come back to life.

64
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,883
Have you found out the story yet
what happened to them?

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,765
No, she doesn't really like
talking about it.

66
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,326
Are you not super curious?
Oh, I would be.

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,965
Yeah, you know, it's...

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,970
- It's none of my business.
- Maybe they're not really dead.

69
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,242
Maybe she doesn't know
what the word "orphan" means.

70
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,887
Maybe she thinks it just means...
house proud.

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,690
I'm leaving now.

72
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,369
- Um, Roy...
- Yeah?

73
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,849
What's that jacket for?

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,289
It's not for anything.

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,563
Will you be wearing that
all the time now?

76
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,241
Yeah, maybe.
Julia thinks I can pull it off.

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,883
- You don't like it?
- It's the worst thing ever!

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,002
You look like a tall girl.

79
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,489
Maybe a little feminine.

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,444
Ah, well, I can understand
why you wouldn't like it, then.

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,881
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, come on, this Linda business?

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,764
We get this six or seven times a week,

83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,121
it's always the same,
it's never about a man.

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,207
You're just one of those women.

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,324
You're one of those women
who don't like women.

86
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,246
Burn it.

87
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,288
You should burn the jacket.

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,641
- And all this for Sports Relief?
- We all have to do our bit.

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,761
First you made me want
to go to the toilet,

90
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,884
and now you make me
want to be a better person.

91
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,647
Bit of news on the Bernatelli front,
by the way, Douglas.

92
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,047
His translator is sick,
so we'll have to hire one.

93
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,969
I could translate if you want.

94
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,969
Can you speak Italian, Jen?

95
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,527
Very impressive.

96
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,963
Not before I've flushed the toilet,
thank you very much.

97
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,565
- Beautiful and delicate young lady.

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,250
- With such butch hands.
- Oh!

99
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,124
I'm kidding, I'm kidding,
you've got lovely hands.

100
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,686
And that's a lovely ring.
I don't think I've noticed that before.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,370
It was my mum's.

102
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,281
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Julia.
I didn't mean to...

103
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,243
I know you don't like
talking about all that stuff.

104
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,771
- No, I'm sorry, Roy.
- Yeah?

105
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,325
I should just tell you the whole story

106
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,930
because you're going to have to know
sooner or later.

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,041
Mmm-hmm.

108
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,241
If you don't mind,

109
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,964
- I'd like to get it all out now.
- Okay. Sure.

110
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,764
Just as long as we never
talk about it again.

111
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,644
Yeah.

112
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,844
There was a fire.

113
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,922
A fire? Oh, God, that's awful!
Oh, I'm so sorry.

114
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,643
We were on holiday.
We went to a Sea Parks.

115
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,367
- You know, Sea Parks like SeaWorld.
- Yeah, sure, Sea Parks.

116
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,280
- It was during a sea lion show.
- Oh...

117
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,481
A fire...

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,682
...during a sea lion show...

119
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,130
...at Sea Parks?

120
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,563
The flames surrounded us so quickly
and we couldn't... We couldn't...

121
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,808
- Oh, are you okay?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

122
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,563
Just, just promise me
we'll never talk about it again.

123
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,921
Sure. Of course, of course.

124
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,323
- But how did the...
- I don't want to talk about it!

125
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,243
You don't speak Italian?

126
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,121
No.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,683
Why did you say you did?

128
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,646
No one was paying any attention to me.

129
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,691
So, what did you actually say
at the meeting?

130
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,211
I don't know.

131
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,003
Very impressive.

132
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,331
He wants me to do
a conference call with him.

133
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,364
- What am I going to do?
- All these lies, Jen.

134
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,883
This is exactly what happened
with the Iraq War.

135
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,283
It's not that much of a lie, Moss,
because I have always wanted

136
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,802
to speak Italian and I can sound
like I'm speaking Italian,

137
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,526
so it's more or less the same thing.

138
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,167
Yeah, except to Italians
or people who can understand Italian.

139
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,407
Exactly. Oh, God!

140
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,087
I'm just going to blue-sky this.

141
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,371
Would it be of any help whatsoever

142
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,882
if I were to install a voice-activated
translation programme on your laptop?

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,162
No, stupid idea, stupid idea.

144
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,050
No, no, no, no. Voice activate...
Does that mean someone would speak

145
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,401
and a translation would appear
on a computer screen?

146
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,081
Actually, now that you put it like that,
that could work.

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,367
Well done. Good idea, Jen.

148
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,445
Thank you?

149
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,805
The jacket!
He's still wearing the jacket!

150
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,769
You all right, Roy?

151
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,769
Is it the jacket?

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,764
Because it should be.

153
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,440
- No, it's, um...
- What?

154
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,885
Julia told me the story.

155
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,321
- So, what happened?
- Her parents died in a fire.

156
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,002
- Oh, God, I'm sorry, that's horrible.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it was a fire.

157
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,771
At Sea Parks.

158
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,569
- Sea Parks?
- Yeah.

159
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,363
- With the...
- With the whales and everything, yeah.

160
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
Oh, okay.

161
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,242
- Sea Parks?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,724
- Huh.
- Yeah.

163
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,048
- A fire?
- That's right.

164
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,441
At the sea lion show, apparently.

165
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,807
Aren't those shows
usually out in the open?

166
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,163
Well, yeah. Yeah, I mean,
that's what I would've...

167
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,847
- Yeah.
- Lots of water everywhere.

168
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,531
Yeah, I mean, I would imagine
the whales need a lot of water.

169
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,166
I don't think you can have
whales in a place

170
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,011
where there isn't a huge amount
of water.

171
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,605
It just seems like a weird place
to go on fire.

172
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,806
It's a very weird place to go on fire!
A fire at a Sea Parks?

173
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,291
It's the weirdest thing I've ever heard!

174
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,090
I mean, maybe...

175
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,321
Maybe if there were plastic seats,
maybe they could go on...

176
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,091
They don't have plastic seats
at Sea Parks.

177
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,201
How do you know?

178
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,449
Roy, when I was on holiday,
I lived at Sea Parks.

179
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,810
It's the funnest, wettest,
most splish-splashy place in the world.

180
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,889
Okay, did you go
and see the sea lion show?

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,241
Three times a day for two weeks.

182
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,842
- And did they have plastic...
- No, it's all stone steps.

183
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,929
Then what went on fire?

184
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,684
I've checked Wikipedia. There is no
mention of a fire at any Sea Parks.

185
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,723
Do you think maybe she's lying?

186
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,003
No. I mean, why would she lie?

187
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,762
And if she was going to lie,
why would she use this one?

188
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,484
A fire at a Sea Parks?
It's wrecking my head!

189
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,171
I mean, if she had said
that her parents had drowned,

190
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,851
I'd be the happiest man in the world.

191
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,645
But a fire? At a Sea Parks?

192
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,169
I mean, it's just... It just...
Oh, it's just...

193
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,089
It opens up a lot of questions.

194
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,166
- Well, maybe you could ask her.
- No, no, no, no.

195
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,647
We can never talk about it again.

196
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,049
- Well, maybe you could just...
- No, no. No, no, no.

197
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,482
We can never talk about it
for the rest of our lives.

198
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,165
Well, then I suppose
you're just going to have to

199
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,521
try and stop thinking about it.

200
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,209
That's another great idea!
You're on fire!

201
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,927
If you'll pardon the expression.

202
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,811
I would be very happy
to come and have a look.

203
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,366
Uh, next week is good for me.

204
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,881
We're certainly looking forward
to your visit

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,641
and can't wait to give you
the full Reynholm Industries experience.

206
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,602
He says he's looking forward
to meeting me.

207
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,960
Oh! Okay.

208
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,281
Ciao.

209
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,848
Maybe you're the best woman.

210
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,809
12 exits!

211
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,082
There are 12 exits!

212
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,202
- What are you doing?
- Ooh. What?

213
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,286
What are you doing on the computer?

214
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,811
Masturbating.

215
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,690
Badoo!

216
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,766
Badoo!

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,411
Badoo!

218
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,722
Isn't it Bernatelli today?
Shouldn't you be preparing?

219
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,000
No, I think I'm okay, Moss.

220
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,283
I've learnt a few conversational basics
and when he gets going,

221
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,402
I'll just fire up this baby.

222
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,046
I do want to feel refreshed, though
for the meeting,

223
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,367
so I'm going to go to sleep
for a few hours.

224
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,530
Is that what you're having for lunch?
A big pile of mashed potato?

225
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,251
I fancied it.

226
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,562
It's the Sea Parks, isn't it?

227
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,049
You're building a Sea Parks
out of mashed potato!

228
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,008
There are 12 exits, Moss.
12 exits for only 200 people.

229
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,481
You going Close Encounters crazy, Roy.
You need to let it go.

230
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,003
To have killed anyone, the fire
has to start here, here and here.

231
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,442
And close in like this.
But how's it spreading?

232
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,967
There's no wood in a Sea Parks arena.

233
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,163
And why is there no wood?
Because it rots.

234
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,682
And why does it rot?
Because of all the water.

235
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,848
Damn, that mash looks tasty!

236
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,960
Password?
You didn't ask for a password before.

237
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,441
Moss!

238
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,406
Where's Moss?

239
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,251
It's payday.
He's probably gone to Namco.

240
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,885
Where's Namco?

241
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,085
Flip! It's an iPhone!

242
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,601
It's a flipping iPhone
in the crane machine!

243
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,488
Oh! Plum out of coin!

244
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,966
Moss!

245
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,760
Oh, Moss.

246
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,289
What am I going to do?

247
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,289
What are you...
How did you get in there?

248
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,248
Through the hole.

249
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,401
Why?

250
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,444
There's an iPhone, Jen.
An actual iPhone.

251
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,801
I need your password.

252
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,491
I need the password
of the translation programme.

253
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,683
Help me get the iPhone first.
I can't move my arms.

254
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,643
- No.
- I need to get it through the shoot.

255
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,364
Someone else will take it if you don't.

256
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,131
I'm sure they're not giving it away.
The engineer must have dropped it.

257
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,527
No, no, no. It's a prize, it's a prize,
you've got to help.

258
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,803
- I don't have time.
- But it's an iPhone, Jen.

259
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,964
I may be able to get an iPhone
without giving any money to Apple.

260
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,923
I'll be living the dream.

261
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,690
What's the password?

262
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,529
What's the password?

263
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,082
Moss! Moss!

264
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,968
"Oh, I'm so excited
about the sea lion show.

265
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,486
"Oh, yay!"

266
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,004
"Um, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Luigi,

267
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,727
"Joe and Slippery Pete!"

268
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,931
"Yay, yay! Whoo! Whoo!"

269
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,170
"Oh, no! What's all this smoke?"

270
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,246
Oh, smoke.

271
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,649
Where will I get smoke?

272
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,281
Yes.

273
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,448
I got it! I got it! I got it!

274
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,405
Where is it?

275
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,764
I think I must be blocking it.
I'll try and move to clear the passage.

276
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,484
Come on, Moss.

277
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,683
Come on, Moss, you can do it. Push.

278
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,844
Come on, Moss. Keep breathing.

279
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,169
- Push!
- Shut up!

280
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,966
- You can do it, Moss.
- I hate you!

281
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,243
- Why are you saying that?
- I don't know. Stop talking!

282
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,368
Come on, Moss. Come on!

283
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,886
Perfect.

284
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,642
It's coming! I can see it,
I can see the start button.

285
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,765
One last push! One, two, three, push!

286
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,362
Come on, Moss. Push! Push!

287
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,970
It's beautiful.

288
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,000
Password!

289
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,806
Where the hell have you been?

290
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,285
Sorry. It was just...

291
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,121
It doesn't matter. So far,
he's satisfied with general laughter.

292
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,801
Mr Bernatelli, meet Jen.

293
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,848
Viennetta, Fiat Punto.

294
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,242
Leave that laptop outside.

295
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,926
- No. What?
- We have to think about security, Jen.

296
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,840
How do we know that laptop isn't somehow
able to connect to the internet?

297
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,682
- No, no, it is a...
- Then get it out of here!

298
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,528
Look! Look at this. Look at how long
it's taking to go on fire.

299
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,324
And this is made of matches.

300
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,843
So, first of all, I'd like to extend
the warmest welcome to Mr Bernatelli

301
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,405
and hope today is the beginning of
a long and fruitful partnership.

302
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,809
Alora.

E macarena, macchiato, Luca Brasi,
Gianluca Viallis, Sophia Loren.

305
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,644
He says it's a pleasure to be here.

306
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,410
Hey.

307
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,248
I see. So, if the fire started here,
and they were there,

308
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,328
then there's no way
they could've escaped.

309
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,568
So they must've been there.

310
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,206
Ah! Ah!

311
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,648
Oh, look at this. Actually... Stop it!

312
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,401
Go out.

313
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,650
Ow, my hands!

314
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,202
Passe con Baccarat con du Super Mario.

315
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,890
I have always wanted to visit England.

316
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,001
Hey.

317
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,767
Uh, I'm looking forward to sampling some
of your famous English food.

318
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,160
Well, I'm sure that can be arranged.

319
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,001
Um, bella, bella, arrangella.

320
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,201
So, what do you want to talk about?

321
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,845
Ah, now you listen to me, Bernatelli.

322
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,246
Me listena Bernatelli.

323
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,409
I hope by the end of this meeting,
we can become firm friends.

324
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,046
...firma frienda.

325
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,971
I like you and I like what you've done
with your company.

326
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,367
...compania.

327
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,280
Hopefully, we can join forces and plough
our way through these uncertain times.

328
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,006
Hopefully join-a force-a
di plough uncertain time-a.

329
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,160
What do you say?
Bernatelli and Reynholm Industries.

330
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,408
Together we'll be bigger than ever.

331
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,684
Bernatelli e Reynholm Industries,
della fella bella, bigger than evera.

332
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,529
Hey! I'm going to stand up
and start talking slightly louder.

333
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,401
Do you like my suit or not?

334
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,681
The woman to my left
smells like she's been for a run.

335
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,730
This meeting is going better
than you might think.

336
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,769
I love what you have done
with this office.

337
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,451
Can I borrow some of your erotic art?

338
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,126
For how long?

339
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,120
On second thoughts, I'm going to go.

340
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,326
Never contact me again,
because I'm mental.

341
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,761
Well, that was a waste of time.

342
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,842
Next time you have a bright idea, Linda,
keep it to yourself.

343
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,645
- But...
- And for God's sake, get a shower!

344
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,283
- Oh, my God! Roy!
- Hiya.

345
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,523
Oh, my God, you poor thing.
Look at your hands.

346
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,884
How did that happen?

347
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,410
It's kind of hard to explain.

348
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,444
- But what...
- I don't want to talk about it!

349
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,286
Moss!

350
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,406
Hello?

351
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,686
Hello!

352
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,521
Starting to get pretty lonely now.

353
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,122
These toys may smell of wee
come the morn.
