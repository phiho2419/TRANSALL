1
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,204
- You there!
- Oh!

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,850
Blind, wizened man! I have come from
a faraway place to seek a great sorcerer.

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,325
- I am whom you seek.
- You?

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,569
Why, you are nothing but
an old man in a tent, sitting in rags,

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,251
playing hoop-a-Lou with the wind.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,966
- You wish for proof?
- Aye.

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,800
Pick... pick a card.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,447
Don't show me!
Put it back in the pack.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,804
Is this your card?

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,289
No, but damn close.
You are the man I seek.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,926
Come, sit. Tell me a tale.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,204
- It is a woman.
- It is always a woman.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,405
Her sweet voice
wakes a mighty tiger behind my fly.

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,251
Yet she is proud
and will not have me.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,648
Her name is Jane or Jan
or something similar.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,004
- You would have her to your bed, would you?
- Aye. A thousand times aye.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,440
Take this tinc... tinc... ticture...
tincture, and put it in her drink.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,484
She will be yours within moments.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,368
Thank you. I will use it well.

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,487
- Agh! What's that for?
- I'm sorry. It was an accident.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,127
- Why did you do that? It really hurt!
- Like I say, it was an accident.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,686
- It was full of coins!
- All right, I've apologised once.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,361
- That was a really stupid thing to do!
- You could have caught it, you idiot.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,370
- A stupid thing to do!
- I haven't got time for this bullshit.

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,163
- What level is this?
- Shut up!

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,006
- Oh, my God.
- Whoo!

27
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,565
- That was perfect.
- Oh, I rock.

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,364
- I didn't miss a single note.
- My God.

29
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,371
- I am wasting my life! I am wasting my life.
- Well, how?

30
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,963
Oh, I am so good at this. Why am I so good at
this? What, am I going to put this on my CV?

31
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,243
- Oh, can't something just be fun?
- No, put it away, please.

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,250
- But we've got a really big gig coming up.
- Put it away.

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,647
- All right, Yoko.
- Oh, God.

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,205
Are you still in the same clothes
you were yesterday?

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,290
I, uh, may have met a lady
in the pub last night.

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,606
Oh, yeah?

37
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,042
Oh, yes. It, um...
it was quite a memorable evening.

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,686
Good for you.

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,131
Hello?

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,368
Oh, Stephanie, hi.

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,926
Oh, God. Right, OK, yeah.

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,771
Yeah, yeah. I'll send him right up...
I'll be right up. Bye.

43
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,120
Douglas again?

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,041
Yeah. Yeah, he keeps bringing me up
on all these flimsy pretexts.

45
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,209
The other day
it was to show me a dead fly.

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,045
Fly!

47
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,681
Yeah, it's getting a little ridiculous.

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,680
Wait until I tell you
what happened to me last night.

49
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,047
Wait till I tell you
what's just happened to me.

50
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,166
I bought this muffin from the canteen, and I'll
be jolly rogered if there's not hypricide in it.

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,042
Curium... ebrium... and unless I'm
going crazy, that's selenium.

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,882
It's definitely hypricide, and it's not
even listed in the table of contents!

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,049
That was a great story. Um...

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,162
You remember
the woman from last night?

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,762
- She seemed lovely, right?
- She was a delight.

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,444
Yeah. We get outside, there's a group of
tramps, two of whom she knows by name.

57
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,281
She starts screaming at them,
"You owe me money! You owe me money!"

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,371
She thinks that
the tramps owe her money.

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,962
Next thing I know, it all kicks off.
I'm running for my life.

60
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,723
It was a horrible evening, a really horrible
evening, and she's a really horrible woman.

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,081
Right. But you slept with her?

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,931
Yeah.

63
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,482
Ah, Jen.

64
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,921
I've been expecting you.

65
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,089
You asked me to come up.

66
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,171
Which is why
I've been expecting you.

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,567
Anyway, I'm glad
we got that cleared up.

68
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,561
I've got a lot of important papers to
look over, so, uh, if you don't mind...

69
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,163
- What, leave?
- Yes, please.

70
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,729
I like you, Jen.

71
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,968
You don't ask questions.

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,680
A lot of people would be confused
as to why I invited them up here

73
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,331
then asked them to leave. Not you.

74
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,367
A person's got to have a lot of backbone to
allow herself to be ordered around like that.

75
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,450
You've got spunk and balls.

76
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,847
And I like that in a woman.

77
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,040
- Thank you.
- Which is why I'd like you to be my PA.

78
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,367
- Really?
- Yes. Stephanie's leaving.

79
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,404
- Definitely?
- No. Stephanie.

80
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,091
Come sit on my big hand.

81
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,930
There's a huge pay rise,

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,046
and the chance of many wonderful opportunities
you'd be crazy to pass up. Sex.

83
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,410
- What?
- What?

84
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,321
- Did you just say "sex"?
- I don't think so. Come on, Jen!

85
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,241
I need your mind on the job,
not thinking about sexy sex all the time.

86
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,969
It's true I have been accused of sexy
shenanigans against my female employees...

87
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,607
- Yes, there's that court case.
- Yeah, but she'll settle.

88
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,041
That was the old me.
This is the new me.

89
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,370
And I want you to be a part of it.
A part of me. Sex...

90
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,884
- Moss, I've got something to tell you.
- Oh, my God!

91
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,405
- Wait till I tell you.
- Ah. Yeah. Sorry.

92
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,763
- Where's Roy? He should be here.
- Before you begin, I should tell you

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,645
that I sometimes have problems
processing big news.

94
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,367
Douglas has asked me to be his PA.

95
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,245
Oh, my God!

96
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,885
His PA!

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,561
Oh, my God!

98
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,207
Well, that is something and a half.

99
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,802
His PA. How... Whoa!

100
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,005
His PA... Shut up! His PA!

101
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,681
- It means "personal assistant".
- Thank you.

102
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,610
Right, OK.
What does that actually involve?

103
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,044
Oh, you know - picking up his mail, going to
the supermarket for him, getting his washing.

104
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,926
I have to say, Moss,
it's a real step up.

105
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,407
Right. How are you going to do that
and work here?

106
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,888
That's the thing. He doesn't want me to.
He wants me to quit the department.

107
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,482
- You're not going to do it, are you?
- Well, there's a huge pay rise.

108
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,364
Phew. So "no".

109
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,927
- No, no, I probably am.
- But what about the pay rise?

110
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,451
- That's if I go.
- Right.

111
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,201
He's not paying me more
to stay here.

112
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,406
Of course not.
That'd be ridiculous.

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,126
So, am I getting a pay rise?

114
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,163
Why would you get a pay rise?

115
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,681
- OK, let's just start again.
- Yeah.

116
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,486
Douglas wants me to be your PA.

117
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,080
- No!
- Then why am I getting a pay rise?

118
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,328
Whoa! Whoa!
Why is he getting a pay rise?

119
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,124
Jen wants me to be her PA.

120
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,722
Where did you get this?
It's Douglas who wants the PA.

121
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,002
I don't want to be Douglas's PA.

122
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,122
He's not really qualified, Jen.

123
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,642
And do you even have the authority
to offer me a pay rise?

124
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,446
I don't want you to be my PA.
It's Douglas who wants me to be his PA.

125
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,169
That's it. That's all there is. You don't
come into it. You're not involved at all.

126
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,442
Who's Douglas?

127
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,928
- Oh, so... Douglas wants you to be his PA?
- Yes.

128
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,364
- Are you gonna do it?
- I dunno. It's an opportunity, you know?

129
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,006
- Yeah, I mean, you should probably do it.
- Yeah?

130
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,251
Yeah. You don't wanna be stuck down here for
the rest of your life playing <i>Guitar Hero.</i>

131
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,049
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, I think
I'll say yes. I think I have to.

132
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,801
You guys'll probably be
glad to see the back of me.

133
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,008
Wow, you're just gonna
let that hang there.

134
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,441
No, I'm joking.
Of course we won't.

135
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,801
Hello?

136
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,651
Oh, for fu... OK. Um...

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,843
OK. Um...
Could you stop shouting at me?

138
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,089
OK, stop shouting at me.
I told you not to call me at work...

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,010
How are you drunk again?
It's not even noon!

140
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,889
Who is this? Yeah, yeah, this is his wife.
Please don't call here again.

141
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,920
Yep. What are you gonna do
without me?

142
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,409
Moss? You know that list of things
we're not allowed to do when Jen's here?

143
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,969
- Yeah.
- I think it's time for a printout.

144
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,927
Oh, my word.

145
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,486
Oh, God. Oh...

146
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,046
Oh, bloody hell!

147
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,171
Oh, this is amazing.

148
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,527
Get in.

149
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,041
Welcome to the 30th floor, Jen.

150
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,802
Come with me.
I, uh... I wanna show you something.

151
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,170
- Two of them now!
- Yes.

152
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,084
Do you want me
to get rid of them?

153
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,761
Ten minutes in
and you've already paid for yourself.

154
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,651
So Terry can do squash
on the Tuesday,

155
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,808
Lucinda says she can't wait,

156
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,324
and Chessington World of Adventures say they're
very sorry but you're not allowed back.

157
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,128
Whatever.

158
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,560
How long have you been working for me now,
Jen? Three, four months, is it?

159
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,331
Well, no. It's just been today.

160
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,129
You're right. We went jogging, I knackered
that squirrel, and that hand thing happened...

161
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,322
It feels longer.

162
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,284
Feels like we've built up
a, uh... connection.

163
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,801
Yes, yes. A <i>business</i> connection.

164
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,287
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
More than that, though.

165
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,641
No. No, I don't think so.

166
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,721
Ooh. I feel like "mmmm".
Know what I mean?

167
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,767
I do, and I disagree.
Anyway, these came back today...

168
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,488
Come on, Jen!
Ever feel like just having some fun?

169
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,640
Mr Reynholm, I am a professional.
I take my job seriously.

170
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,560
If I wasn't able to do it properly I'd be letting
myself down and I'd be letting you down.

171
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,766
So please, either let me do my job
or let me go.

172
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,325
Anyway, these came back today.

173
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,604
They said they've done their very best,
but some of the stains just won't come out.

174
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,729
- Good God.
- Mr Reynholm?

175
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,209
- You looked exactly like Melissa there.
- Melissa?

176
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,722
My wife. She died.

177
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,968
Oh, poor you. That's terrible.

178
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,041
There's not a day goes past
that I don't think of her.

179
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,725
I'll never forget our final moments.

180
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,447
<i>Help me!
My husband's trying to kill me!</i>

181
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,848
Oh! Oh, I'm so, so sorry. Oh...

182
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,724
- Would you do me a favour?
- What?

183
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,004
I want to feel like Melissa is alive,
just one last time.

184
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,485
OK...

185
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,444
- Here's a selection of her lingerie.
- Oh, Mr Reynholm...

186
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,040
Oh, please, please
dress as my sexy dead wife.

187
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,530
Oh, this isn't working out. I thought
given time you'd get past the sex thing,

188
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,881
but you obviously can't.

189
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,164
I'm going back to IT,
where my <i>skills</i> are appreciated.

190
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,842
I'm not interested in you sexually,
and I never will be.

191
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,690
I didn't want it to come to this, Jen,

192
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,371
but would you like a cup of tea?

193
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,042
<i>Very busy. Leave a message.</i>

194
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,804
Before you do this, you're absolutely sure
you can hit it in such a way

195
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,810
that it won't damage my teeth
as it goes in?

196
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,447
- It's a very simple chip shot, Moss.
- All right.

197
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,443
Wow!

198
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,882
You totalled that cup, dude.

199
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,686
- OK. One more try.
- Jen would never have let us do this.

200
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,964
No. She'd be all, like, "Oh, this is
dangerous. You're gonna hit Moss in the face."

201
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,926
How many more things
have we got left on the list?

202
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,567
I think we've done nearly all of 'em.

203
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,363
Yeah. OK, we've had a little sleep,
we're walking round in our pants...

204
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,131
The only thing left to do
is the prank phone call.

205
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,404
OK, all right,
but let's concentrate on this first.

206
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,131
Whoops!

207
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,128
OK, do it again.

208
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,842
Two lovely cups of tea.
I'm like your PA, cos I made the tea.

209
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,682
Hang on.

210
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,169
We both take it the same way,
Douglas, so...

211
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,609
- Aren't you gonna drink it?
- I will in a bit.

212
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,406
- So... well done on passing the test, Jen.
- The test?

213
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,082
Yes. All those clumsy attempts at seduction.
Don't tell me you couldn't see through them.

214
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,682
They were a test to find out whether
you really wanted to work for me,

215
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,441
or whether you just wanted
to come up here for my body.

216
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,803
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, not at all.
- All right.

217
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,651
No, physically you're
just not the sort of man I go for.

218
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,445
- Yeah, thanks, Jen.
- I go for classically good-looking men.

219
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,881
- OK.
- Blond, broad and generally clean-shaven.

220
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,561
All right, yeah,
enough of the jibber-jabber!

221
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,446
I want you to watch this DVD presentation
I've just made.

222
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,450
Any thoughts?

223
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,928
- I haven't seen it yet.
- Then see it now!

224
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,568
Shh!

225
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,204
Hello. I'd like to order a pizza, please.

226
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,120
And can I have it
with extra grapes?

227
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,527
Grapes! What are you like?

228
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,130
Yes, a pizza with grapes, please.

229
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,443
What?

230
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,484
You have a pizza with grapes?

231
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,887
Do grapes even go with pizza?

232
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,048
Ohhhh, I see.

233
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,571
Oh, you got me.

234
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,321
Oh. Oh, very funny. Very mature.

235
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,887
You know,
you're only wasting your own time!

236
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,690
I wish I could have seen
the look on his face!

237
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,528
I can't believe
we've done the whole list.

238
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,967
We've really done all eight items?

239
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,808
Yep.

240
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,649
- Do you wanna play <i>Guitar Hero?</i>
- No, I hate those kind of games.

241
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,127
- Oh! I've got one.
- What? What?

242
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,964
Why-why don't we ring them up again, and ask
if they do a pizza with <i>pineapple</i> on it?!

243
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,320
Maybe somebody's computer will break.

244
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,444
I think you'd enjoy this more
while drinking your tea.

245
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,086
<i>Reynholm Industries.
A big hard business in a big hard building.</i>

246
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,646
<i>Thrusting into the future strongly,</i>

247
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,444
<i>again and again.</i>

248
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,690
<i>Pounding the future,
making the future beg for it</i>

249
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,442
<i>The future wants it, and Reynholm
Industries wants to give it to the future.</i>

250
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,449
<i>That's what it's all about.</i>

251
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,801
<i>We don't want to be like a deadfy,</i>

252
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,561
<i>regretting what we didn't do
in our short time on this Earth.</i>

253
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,446
<i>So maybe it's time to make a decision.</i>

254
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,525
What was that?

255
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,211
- What happened?
- Something just flashed up there.

256
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,004
- Are you sure?
- Let me rewind.

257
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,566
- <i>Decision.</i>
- Aaaaaaaagh!

258
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,762
There it is again.

259
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,646
Something's wrong with your laptop.
I'll call the boys.

260
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,807
Hello? IT.

261
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,241
Roy, hello.
I didn't even hear the phone ring.

262
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,409
Oh, hello, Jen! Jen! Hello, Jen!
It's Jen!

263
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,090
- Hello, Jen!
- Hi.

264
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,441
Well, h-h-how are you, Jen?

265
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,326
- Good, yeah. Listen, Douglas's computer...
- What's been happening?

266
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,329
- What?
- How's everything upstairs?

267
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,249
- Tell her I'm here.
- Moss is with me.

268
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,527
You do know
I spoke to you four hours ago?

269
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,210
- Yeah.
- Hello, Jen.

270
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,369
Oh, Jen? Jen?
When are you coming back down?

271
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,403
- Let me speak to her.
- No! I'm talking to her!

272
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,082
I dunno. Listen, listen. Douglas's
laptop is having some difficulties...

273
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,283
<i>so could you come up and have a look?</i>

274
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,841
Oh, no, not these idiots.

275
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,161
Mr Reynholm, the men in the IT department
are my friends. They're not idiots.

276
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,080
- Hello, Jen.
- Hi, Jen.

277
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,522
- What the hell is this?
- Where the hell are your trousers?

278
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,531
- Oh, for f...
- Oh, I get it. When the cat's away.

279
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,282
Yeah. It's like all the fun I had
just after my wife died.

280
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,566
Listen, don't sit on anything.
And, um... Mr Reynholm's laptop is broken.

281
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,570
- Something flashed up...
- I'll get it. I'll help her.

282
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,730
- Have you tried turning it off and on again?
- No, we haven't tried that.

283
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,401
- Well, let's have a little look-see.
- I want a go! I want to do a job!

284
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,126
- You can do the next one!
- Don't touch that.

285
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,448
Why are you drinking Rohypnol, Jen?

286
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,648
Flunitrazepam, histomet...

287
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,890
Yep, that's definitely Rohypnol. Are you
having problems with insomnia, or...?

288
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,571
- That's nonsense.
- Drink it, then.

289
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,648
All right, I will.

290
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,805
There we go.
A perfectly normal cup of tea.

291
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,571
Now, if you don't mind,
I have some... folloffing to do.

292
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,091
Folloffing?

293
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,081
Yes. I have some folloffels that need
pipping, and I'm... the moulder...

294
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,010
You did put something in that tea!

295
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,809
Damn that sorcerer! 20 gold pieces
and I'm wankered on Rohypnol!

296
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,883
Oh, God! Rohypnol!
And what's the matter with you?

297
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,765
I just saw his film.

298
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,042
I didn't care for it.

299
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,607
I am very aroused.

300
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,688
I wanna come back downstairs
with you guys.

301
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,327
- No, it's all right. We've got a replacement.
- Oh, shut up!

302
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,044
Oh, right. OK. Who's that?

303
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,243
- It's an answering machine.
- An answering machine?

304
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,161
It's called Jen II. It does everything you do,
and it doesn't boss us about. It is brilliant.

305
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,408
Oh, shut up, for God's sake.

306
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,841
You replaced me
with an answering machine?

307
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,284
OK, I think we should probably leave now.
I don't really like the look in his eyes.

308
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,245
Let's go. Let's go.

309
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,805
Where's Jen?

310
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,366
Jen? Jen?

311
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,087
Pucker up, boys.
It's Hammertime.

312
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,203
- Jen!
- You lot deserve each other!

313
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,845
<i>Jen?</i> Jen? Hello?

314
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,760
I think you may have
accidentally locked the door there, Jen.

315
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,646
Jen! Jen!

316
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,527
- Hello, Jen?
<i>- Jen!</i> Come on, Jen! Jen...
