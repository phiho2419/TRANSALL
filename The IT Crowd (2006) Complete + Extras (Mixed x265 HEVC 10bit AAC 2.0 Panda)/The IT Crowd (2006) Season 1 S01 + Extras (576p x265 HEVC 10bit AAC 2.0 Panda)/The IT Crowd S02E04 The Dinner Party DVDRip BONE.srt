1
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,368
And then Peter said, "Brie - that's
my favourite cheese as well."

2
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,202
And that was when my bag, I don't know what
happened, but it just kind of split open.

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,211
- Apples and oranges rolling everywhere.
- And we just tumbled about.

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,687
Like a pair of confused little kittens.

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,804
And when Peter had
helped me pick everything up,

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,003
it just seemed rude
not to give him my number.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,122
Hey! I thought you asked for my number.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,607
Ha, ha, ha! I'm not a slut.

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,042
Oh, is that the end of the story? Aww!

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,288
- OK, are we all set for tonight?
- Yes.

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,962
Can you please bring me some wine?

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,168
That was some...
Oh, buying the same sort of cheese?

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,523
Oh, you made a 20-minute story out of it.

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,610
Have you thought of
adapting it into a film?

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,404
No.

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
Well done, you've bagged a normal.

17
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,843
Yes, he is proper normal, isn't he?

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,760
- He's taking me to Paris this weekend.
- Oh, Paris.

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,202
- Oh, have you been to Paris, Moss?
- No.

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,721
I've heard of it.

21
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,249
- Brie?
- Yeah, what?

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,491
Oh, nothing. Just I've always had you down
as more of a double Gloucester type person.

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,365
Yes, I know what you mean.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,170
Oh, it's been ages since
I had a mini break.

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,366
Not only that, but all of my friends
are single, and so are all of his.

26
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,929
So tonight we're going to have a big dinner
party. Oh, it's just going to be brilliant.

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,249
Or perhaps that should be "brie-lliant".

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,127
Do you know, it is really important to me
that you like him.

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,210
No, honestly, it is.
I know we had some rocky beginnings,

30
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,804
but I really think of you now, not just
as my workmates any more, but as friends.

31
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,720
- Stop it.
- No, I mean that. I really do.

32
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,081
You're all really important to me.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,200
Listen, Jen, I've got some bad news.
Colin can't make it tonight.

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,085
Oh. But Steve and Jake are still coming?

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,771
Colin was bringing Stephen and Jake.
I don't know them very well.

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,962
- I'd be uncomfortable without Colin there.
- Oh.

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,970
I suppose we're just going to have
to call the whole thing off.

38
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,005
Unless you can find three guys
to replace them?

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,525
Yeah, I s...

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,642
Bit of dust. I'm gonna...

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,851
Definitely later, phone the, um...

42
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,370
Strange, I must...

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,801
Oh, look at that.

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,925
Oh, I can't. I can't.

45
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,520
It's my home.
It's my special place.

46
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,850
I can't let you nut jobs
into my special place.

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,804
"Nut jobs"?
I hope you're not including me in that.

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,924
Wait a second.
We were all brilliant friends a minute ago.

49
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,011
Yes. Yes, I meant friends
in a different way.

50
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,809
In a kind of special way,
that means you can't come into my home.

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,122
Right, so sort of like
not being your friends at all?

52
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,325
Yes, yes. Sort of like that,
but in a really special way.

53
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,649
This is your lowest moment, you know.

54
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,808
I think I can live with it.

55
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,609
Roy, can you look at my PC, please?
It keeps freezing.

56
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,169
Did you hear something, Moss?
I thought I heard a noise.

57
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,161
I didn't hear anything, Roy,
unless it was some kind of stupid mouse.

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,443
Yeah, or a rat.

59
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,803
Yes. I think it did sound more like a rat.

60
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,245
I can't bear this.
I know I was horrible. I'm sorry.

61
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,647
Oh, Richmond.

62
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,491
Oh, Richmond, not you too?

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,968
I'm sorry, Richmond.
I just get embarras...

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,928
in...

65
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,563
- Hello.
- Hello!

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,648
Mmm, I smell food.

67
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,761
- What are you doing? Don't sit down yet.
- Why not? I'm tired.

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,282
That's the rules. We stand around
a bit first, we have drinks.

69
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,562
- Where's Peter?
- He's in the kitchen. Look...

70
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,890
- Can I go to the toilet?
- Yes, you may. You don't need to ask.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,651
It's just down there to the left.

72
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,087
- Here you go.
- Ah... Oh, thank you, Roy.

73
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,084
Oh, lovely. White wine. Never seen a wine
actually called "White Wine" before.

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,209
- Thank you, Roy. What are you drinking?
- Red wine, please.

75
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,288
- Richmond?
- Oh, do you have any absinthe?

76
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,971
- No.
- I only drink absinthe.

77
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,731
Absinthe, no.
Red wine, white wine, Carlsberg...

78
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,287
- Oh, Carlsberg. Perfect.
- Right. Well, that was quick.

79
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,243
I washed my hands!

80
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,284
- What do you want to drink, Moss?
- White Russian.

81
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,768
A White Russian?
Oh, for God's sake.

82
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,006
Documentary.

83
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,248
Balsamic vinegar.

84
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,607
Conversation.

85
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,326
Oh, apparently one of Jen's friends
is a model. I bagsy the model.

86
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,490
I bagsy the model, Richmond!
Jen! Jen!

87
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,729
Um, we've discussed it as a group
and we think it would be best

88
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,127
if I were to sit beside the model,

89
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,282
because, um... I would like to ask her how
I would go about becoming a photographer.

90
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,970
Or a model.

91
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,209
Paula? Oh, she'll appreciate that.

92
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,282
She's just had reconstructive face surgery, so
she'll be happy to have someone to talk to.

93
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,367
Right.

94
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,610
It's actually really brave of her to come out,
cos she was in a really bad car accident,

95
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,963
so you have to be extra nice to her.

96
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,761
Car accident? Brilliant. Just my luck.

97
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,611
Now, I'll be honest with you.
The reason I got you round a bit early

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,087
is to go over some ground rules, OK?

99
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,931
If this evening is going
to work in any way,

100
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,408
you need to pretend
to be normal people, yeah?

101
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,966
Keep the conversation about things
that would interest everybody.

102
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,401
You know, nothing about memory or RAM.

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,082
Memory <i>is</i> RAM. Oh, dear.

104
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,091
If you start straying into areas I don't think are
appropriate, I'll... I don't know, I'll cough.

105
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,487
Coughing is a signal, got it.
Richmond, did you hear that?

106
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,444
- What?
- If Jen coughs, we have to stop talking.

107
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,289
Fine.

108
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,243
Oh, and Moss, this is important, OK?
I'm sitting you beside Margaret.

109
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,206
Margaret. From her name,
I presume she is a lady?

110
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,641
Yes. She's very nice.

111
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,809
She got divorced recently, but I should
say, when she's had a few drinks,

112
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,003
she tends to get a bit over-excited.

113
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,361
Needs to go to the toilet a lot.
Yep, that happens to me.

114
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,323
- No.
- I try and think of something dry.

115
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,410
That helps.
Like a desert, or Shredded Wheat.

116
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,967
No, Moss, you don't understand.
What I'm trying to say is, she's kind of...

117
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,731
she's kind of on the lookout for a man.

118
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,721
- Oh, I see. What's he look like?
- What?

119
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,286
He wouldn't come here,
not with all these people around.

120
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,449
- What's this about?
- Jen's friend has got a stalker.

121
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,040
- Cool.
- Oh, God. Maybe I could just kill myself.

122
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,007
OK. Here they are.

123
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,088
So, look normal.

124
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,651
Look more normal, more normal.

125
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,882
Relax.

126
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,840
Oh, forget it.

127
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,360
Hello, hello, come in.

128
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,449
Hello, I'm Roy.

129
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,601
- Sorry to hear about the accident.
- Hello.

130
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,002
This is Paula.

131
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,771
Yep, I know.

132
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,325
I was talking to her.

133
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,490
- Oh, did you think I was talking to you?
- This is Jessica.

134
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,891
Oh, hello, everybody.
Oh, my God. Social situations.

135
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,451
Bloody hell, I think this is my one.

136
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,450
These are my workmates.
They're not my usual friends.

137
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,131
I work with them.
They're my workmates.

138
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,730
Yes.

139
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,528
IT department. Does not compute.

140
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,688
Oh, my God.

141
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,442
- You must be Roy.
- Yeah.

142
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,487
Hello, everybody. I have had a few drinks
already, so no one take advantage of me.

143
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,568
Oh, go on, then!

144
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,201
I was very pleased
with my last campaign, though.

145
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,290
They just started running it today.

146
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,642
Wow!

147
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,922
That's you?

148
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,008
OK.

149
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,930
So...

150
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,850
How bad was the accident?

151
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,487
A motorbike jumped the lights
and so I swerved into a lamppost.

152
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,251
Then the airbag didn't deploy,
so I hit the dashboard pretty hard.

153
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,761
- With your facial area?
- I hit it full in the face.

154
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,451
Of course you did.

155
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,450
- Speed?
- I was doing about 75.

156
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,847
Oh!

157
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,645
That's fast. That's...

158
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,286
When you regained consciousness,

159
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,247
did you look in the mirror and think,
"Oh, God, my face is ruined"?

160
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,726
They wouldn't let me see my face
after the accident.

161
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,241
Ah. I see.

162
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,842
They said it might not be as symmetrical as it
once had been, but symmetry isn't everything.

163
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,928
Yeah, I like symmetry.

164
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,127
Stop it! Stop it!

165
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,971
Stop it, I'm trying to eat my dinner!

166
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,404
Gosh, ooh. Oh, dear.
Look at us, having a conversation.

167
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,602
Yikes.

168
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,726
♪ Getting to know you,
getting to know all about you

169
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,844
Eating. Ooh.
"Hello, how are you?"

170
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,203
"Oh, I'm a fish. Help, I'm being eaten."

171
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,091
You know, when you laugh,
I can see the outline of your skull.

172
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,726
You have a beautiful skull.

173
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,881
OK.

174
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,044
- So, the surgeon...
- Yeah?

175
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,242
- Good man?
- Very good. He did his own nose.

176
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,524
Wow. And did you meet him
before the operation?

177
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,688
Yeah, he ran me through it.
He was really nice.

178
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,930
- Confident?
- Why are you so interested?

179
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,605
My mother... is...
thinking of having a breast augmentation.

180
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,042
- I see.
- Yeah. Always wanted them bigger.

181
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,801
But I promised I'd get
them for her birthday.

182
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,160
- Her 60th's coming up.
- Right.

183
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,406
Well, I think a round of applause
is justified for that dinner.

184
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,086
Yes, and thanks, Peter, for making it.

185
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,289
- So, who's for dessert?
- Isn't this dessert?

186
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,883
- No, that's tartare sauce.
- Can I have some dessert?

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,288
I'll have the tartare sauce.
Stop it! Stop it!

188
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,402
- Look how ticklish he is.
- Stop it!

189
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,488
Come on!

190
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,528
Jen, can you do something about that woman?

191
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,244
- I warned you about her.
- When?

192
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,489
- I spent ten minutes trying to warn you.
- I can see why she's divorced.

193
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,002
She's very divorceable. As soon as you meet
her, you can't wait to take her to court,

194
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,009
- to get rid of her.
- What are you doing?

195
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,604
Well, not that it's any of your business,
but I was planning to have a little poo.

196
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,201
No, no, I mean with Paula.

197
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,290
You keep asking her all those questions
about her accident.

198
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,529
- I'm interested.
- Trying to work out what state her face is in.

199
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,051
Was that obvious?

200
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,767
I suppose I'd better go back in there
and see what Judy Finnigan's up to.

201
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,451
I tell you, if this keeps on going on,
I will divorce her.

202
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,040
You're not married to her.

203
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,324
- No, no. I suppose... I suppose I'm not.
- Come on. Behave yourselves.

204
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,807
There's still a chance to save this thing.

205
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,888
Oh. I... Oh.

206
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,886
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

207
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,971
I said, do you think you'd die
if you drank wee?

208
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,243
I don't know, but it's a
bloody good question.

209
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,570
Here's a question -
who here would eat a spider? I would.

210
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,129
I ate an eel in New York.
I was on stage, so it doesn't count.

211
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,244
Ah, New York, the city of apples.

212
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,804
Oh, Peter, I got that link for the Firefox
extension you were asking about.

213
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,082
- What's your email address?
- Do you have a pen and paper?

214
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,125
- I'm recording.
- It's "FilePeter@hotmail.com".

215
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,484
- File Peter? Why File Peter?
- Well, File is my second name.

216
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,446
- Oh, right. I see. Peter File.
- Who's a paedophile?

217
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,562
- No, no, his name is Peter File.
- His name is Paedophile?

218
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,765
Don't say it like that.
It sounds like "paedophile".

219
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,963
- Isn't that what he just said?
- No. Peter File.

220
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,765
- Paedo-phile?
- Peter File!

221
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,008
- Who's a paedophile?
- No one.

222
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,327
Right. It just sounds like "paedophile".

223
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,681
- No, no, it doesn't.
- Does a bit.

224
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,928
- Peter File.
- Paedophile. Yeah, no, it does.

225
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,726
- Paedophile.
- Peter File. Paedophile.

226
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,127
Yes, I suppose it does!

227
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,202
I hadn't noticed, so...

228
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,647
It doesn't... worry you, does it?

229
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,330
No, no.

230
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,007
Of course it doesn't.

231
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,601
They say "pedophile" in America.
Maybe you should move to America.

232
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,961
He's not moving to America!

233
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,162
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark?</i>

234
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,451
- <i>Circle of Friends?</i>
- It's so obvious.

235
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,211
- No speaking!
- I've been standing here for ten minutes.

236
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,041
- Where's Richmond and Jessica?
- <i>Pirates of the Caribbean!</i>

237
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,685
How is that <i>Pirates of the Caribbean?</i>

238
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,362
I don't know, but it was a great movie,
wasn't it? Johnny Depp, what a revelation.

239
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,567
It's <i>Crash!</i> It's very obviously <i>Crash.</i>
Here's a car crashing into another car,

240
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,891
there's people screaming everywhere
and blood... Oh, Paula, I'm sorry.

241
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,050
- Let's play Spin the Bottle.
- Oh, for God's sake!

242
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,286
- Oh, what?
- Nothing.

243
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,529
- Oh, I'm embarrassing him.
- You're making a fool of yourself.

244
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,404
He's a delicate flower.

245
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,320
- You are drunk.
- If you paid a little more attention to me!

246
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,843
Oh, tell me, Margaret, tell us all, how could
we possibly pay any more attention to you?

247
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,761
Oh, you've changed. You're not the same man
I liked when I came into the party.

248
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,851
We've all changed, Margaret.
We all have.

249
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,808
Oh, for God's sake!

250
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,728
Night, Jen.
Roy's going to walk me home.

251
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,205
Oh, lovely.

252
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,247
Oh, it's just in case any kind of
an Elephant Man mob situation kicks off.

253
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,366
Sorry about Margaret.
It won't happen again.

254
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,087
- Oh, fiddly do.
- Come on, let's get you home.

255
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,969
- Goodbye, Jen.
- Bye, Jen.

256
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,048
Goodbye.

257
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,162
Oh, my God!

258
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,322
Oh!

259
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,081
- Nightmare. An absolute nightmare.
- What do you mean?

260
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,161
Well, I always have this theory that if you let
your work life mix with your personal life,

261
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,250
then somehow, something will go wrong.

262
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,489
But nothing has, has it?
I think it all went rather well.

263
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,729
Everyone seemed to pair off. That's what you
want from an evening like this, isn't it?

264
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,569
Oh, I suppose so.

265
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,403
You're going to have to face the fact you run
a very successful dinner party, Jen Barber.

266
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,922
You didn't do too badly
yourself, Peter File.

267
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,769
- Thanks for walking me home.
- That's OK. Goodbye.

268
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,848
Whoa!

269
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,248
- You live here?
- Yeah.

270
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,731
That's a big telly.

271
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,801
Oh, and all the consoles. You've got all of the
consoles. Why do you have all of the consoles?

272
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,208
I'd hate it if a game came out on
one console and I couldn't play it.

273
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,723
- It's better to get them all, don't you think?
- I do think.

274
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,763
Wow.

275
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,407
- And a man doesn't live here?
- No. Just me.

276
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,405
OK.

277
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,920
- I'm going to gamble.
- What?

278
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,245
Would you like to come out
for a drink sometime?

279
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,761
- Oh.
- You know, like a date kind of a thing.

280
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,486
- What the hell?
- Roy, I'm very flattered...

281
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,766
- OK, good. Of course you are. Thursday?
- ..but you're not my type.

282
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,929
- What?
- I mean physically.

283
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,008
Physically?

284
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,846
Hello.

285
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,486
I think I can do better.

286
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,248
OK.

287
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,767
- Can I have a lend of this?
- No.

288
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,488
Listen, Jen,

289
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,286
when we get back, maybe you should
think about, I don't know,

290
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,370
moving yourself into my place,
vice versa, I don't mind.

291
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,530
But I think it's time we moved on
to the next level, don't you?

292
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,486
- Yes. Yes, definitely.
- Great.

293
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,524
<i>If there is a PeterFile
in the terminal building,</i>

294
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,450
<i>could he please make his way to gate 24?</i>

295
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,528
<i>We are looking fora PeterFile.</i>

296
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,326
- <i>PeterFile, please make yourself known...</i>
- 24? We're at the wrong gate.

297
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,602
<i>Could Peter File please make himself
known to groundstaff?</i>

298
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,203
- That's us, Jen. I'm Peter File!
- <i>We are urgently looking fora PeterFile.</i>

299
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,166
I'm Peter File! Over here.
I'm Peter File! Hold on!

300
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,966
Come on, Jen. I'm Peter File!
I'm Peter File!

301
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,923
It's "Peter File", not "paedophile".

302
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,768
Taxi!

303
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,922
It's very loud. Do you
mind if I turn it down?

304
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,089
I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that.

305
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,762
Oh, dear.
Look at me, having an orgasm.
