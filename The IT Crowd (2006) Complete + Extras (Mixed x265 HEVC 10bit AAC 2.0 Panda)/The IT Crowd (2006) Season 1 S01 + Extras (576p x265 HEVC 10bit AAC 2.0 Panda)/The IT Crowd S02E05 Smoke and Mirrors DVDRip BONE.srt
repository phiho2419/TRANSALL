1
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,207
Morning, beautiful.

2
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,568
Course. I'll send someone up
as soon as I can, OK? Bye.

3
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,160
Ow! Oh!

4
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,725
You're very late. It's been crazy
down here, we've had a call.

5
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,366
- Sorry.
- Oh, God.

6
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,362
Are you all right?

7
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,530
- Are you poorly?
- No, it's just... it's just a bad bra.

8
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,610
It's the only one I had handy this morning
and it's really terrible.

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,406
It's pinching into my sides and the
straps are digging into my shoulders.

10
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,923
All that and it's not even giving
my breasts proper support! It's killing me.

11
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,884
Oh, Moss.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,445
Moss, Moss.

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,131
- Oh, I'm sorry, are you OK?
- What happened?

14
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,005
Sometimes I forget
I'm not just working with other women.

15
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,170
No, it's my fault, I really ought to be able to
listen to a woman talking about bras without...

16
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,691
Ohhh! Moss, Moss.

17
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,202
Oh, hello, good morning, here I am.
Here we go.

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,924
Oh, yeah... Sorry.

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,522
The first time, I-I wasn't expecting you
to start talking about bras

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,931
and then, the second time, it came as a bit of
a surprise to hear myself talking about them.

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,364
- It's been a roller coaster.
- Why don't you have a lie-down in there?

22
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,168
- Morning.
- Morning.

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,442
God, I feel rough.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,801
- Good stag?
- Yeah. Good, you know. Standard stag.

25
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,491
I may have got a little bit drunk
towards the end there.

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,323
Oh, well, what kind of celebration would it
be if you didn't pass out at some point?

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,367
Yeah, thank God nobody noticed.
How do you know I passed out?

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,448
I'm a bit psychic sometimes,

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,042
and I bet you came straight from
the party as well, didn't you?

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,369
That's easy, I'm wearing the same clothes.

31
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,530
Roy, I was trying to remember
how that song goes, "The Locomotion".

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,290
- Do you remember that song?
- Course I remember.

33
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,290
- How's it go again?
- You know it, you must know it.

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,041
- ♪ Everybody is doing a brand-new dance
- No, no, no, no, no, no. It's...

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,642
♪ Everybody's doing
a brand-new dance now

36
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,048
♪ Come on, baby,
do the locomotion

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,961
It is a funny song.

38
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,726
- You all right there?
- Yep. It's just a bad bra.

39
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,525
- Ah.
- Right, I have got to go.

40
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,722
Heads of department meeting.

41
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,242
After last week's fiasco,
I need to make a good impression.

42
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,044
We didn't think you'd believe us.

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,600
I mean, if you'd just stopped
to think about it for one second

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,808
you'd have realised that it wasn't true.

45
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,810
I don't think that's true.

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,527
With all due respect, John,
I am head of IT.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,606
And I have it on good authority.

48
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,486
If you type "google" into Google,

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,331
you can break the internet,

50
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,401
so, please, no one try it, even for a joke.

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,170
It's not a laughing matter.
You can break the internet.

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,250
You don't know what those meetings
are like. They are murder.

53
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,887
It does you no harm
to look a little foolish from time to time.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,925
Roy, there's something
I should let you know.

55
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,768
What?

56
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,204
Stephanie called earlier. Douglas needs
someone to take a look at his computer.

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,970
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Get Moss to do it.

58
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,689
Oh, Moss isn't feeling too well, and besides,
of the two of you, you're the expert.

59
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,451
"The Ordinary Boys".

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,281
Where do they get these crazy names?

61
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,051
<i>Entrare!</i>

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,561
Hi, Mr Reynholm. Roy, IT.

63
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,408
Uh, my computer's...
my computer's broken.

64
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,171
Wow, I have to say
that's a really wild look.

65
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,684
You know, things are moving just so fast,
I can't keep up.

66
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,485
First the Ordinary Boys, and now this.

67
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,409
- Sh-should I check it out?
- Great, yeah.

68
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,000
- Let's get started, shall we?
- What?

69
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,327
What needs my expertise?

70
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,046
You... you did say you were with IT,
didn't you?

71
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,242
Yeah.

72
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,364
Come on, Mr Reynholm, while I'm down here,
I may as well get to work.

73
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,927
OK, I'm gonna move over here.

74
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,406
Sure.

75
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,161
Ah, I can see
why you've been having problems.

76
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,046
See, this isn't actually a computer.
It's a briefcase.

77
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,648
- Excellent.
- I'll have one sent up.

78
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,481
I admire you, Roy.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,331
You've got the guts
to stand up for what you believe in.

80
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,681
OK. See you, then.

81
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,808
Roy...

82
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,490
Good luck.

83
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,160
Which means that we now have the cleanest
toilets of any legal department in London.

84
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,806
- Thank you.
- Well done, James.

85
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,163
You managed to speak for eight minutes
without actually saying anything.

86
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,284
- Oh, I think that, um...
- What? What?

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,728
No, nothing.

88
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,366
Who's next? Right, Jen.
OK, what's going on down in Middle-earth?

89
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,565
Thank you, John,
and prepare to be astonished,

90
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,322
because I have discovered four ways
to increase our online visibility

91
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,569
without spending a single penny.

92
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,606
Number one...

93
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,246
Oh!

94
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,410
Uh... Ha! 'Scuse me, sorry.

95
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,682
Number one... Aah!

96
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,129
Number 0... Aaah!

97
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,883
- The bloody thing!
- For God's sake!

98
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,486
Bloody thing.
Bloody pain in the arse.

99
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,282
I'm a woman.

100
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,084
Ohh!

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,644
<i>It's really pinching my sides.
The straps are digging into my shoulders.</i>

102
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,684
<i>Eh, Moss, look</i> - <i>I'm a woman.</i>

103
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,168
<i>And I love you, Moss.</i>

104
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,203
<i>I love you.</i>

105
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,527
<i>The straps
are digging into my shoulders.</i>

106
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,450
<i>They're not giving my breasts
proper support... proper support...</i>

107
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,927
<i>proper support...
proper support...</i>

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,088
Hang on a second.

109
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,602
Hang on a second.

110
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,409
I've done it.

111
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,488
I've done it!

112
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,887
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Jen.</i>

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,490
Who is this?

114
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,809
<i>That's not important right now.</i>

115
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,006
Well, it says "Moss" on my phone.

116
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,167
<i>Yes, all right, it's me.</i>

117
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,044
Why are you disguising your voice?

118
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,766
<i>Because if someone is listening in
on this conversation,</i>

119
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,360
<i>I don't want them to know my identity.</i>

120
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,326
- But they know now.
- <i>Yes, thanks.</i>

121
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,729
So why don't you use
your normal voice now?

122
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,320
<i>It's attached to the phone
and I'd have to hang it up again...</i>

123
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,930
<i>Look, can you just listen to me?</i>

124
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,042
Why don't you just come in
and speak to me?

125
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,605
Oh, you're...

126
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,167
- You're ruining everything.
- What do you want, Moss?

127
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,170
Take your top off, Jen.

128
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,727
- Sorry?
- You heard me. Take your top off.

129
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,450
- What's this all about, anyway?
- You'll see.

130
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,088
- Is this another one of your inventions?
- Maybe.

131
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,881
What was the last one? Oh, yeah.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,131
A ladder to help moths
escape from the bath.

133
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,244
- How was that useful?
- How's that not useful?

134
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,046
- Moths don't get stuck in baths.
- Yes. They. Do.

135
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,882
Even if that were true,

136
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,643
it's just not in their nature
to learn how to use a ladder.

137
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,403
They have wings.

138
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,249
When a moth thinks about
travelling vertically upwards...

139
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,402
a ladder

140
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,046
is just the last thing they would think of.

141
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,480
Moss, I don't like to be negative about it,
but everything you invent is worthless.

142
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,642
Ah, well, prepare to put mustard on those
words, for you will soon be consuming them,

143
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,684
along with this slice of humble pie

144
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,045
that comes direct from the oven of shame,
set at gas mark egg on your face.

145
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,403
I sort of forget
what I was talking about.

146
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,208
Ah, here's Jen. Oh, that's it, it's a bra.
I've made a brilliant bra.

147
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,890
How are ye?

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,446
Is it, uh... comfortable?

149
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,407
This is possibly the most comfortable bra
I have ever worn.

150
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,366
Donning clothes over a bad bra is like
building a house without laying a foundation.

151
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,891
It's just a false economy,

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,164
and an ill-fitting bra could well ruin your
otherwise painstakingly selected ensemble.

153
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,204
- Wow, you really know your stuff.
- Thank you.

154
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,129
- Google?
- Yeah.

155
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,565
Jen, Roy, bad bras are more
than just a nuisance, they're a menace.

156
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,446
Years of wearing a bad bra can contribute
to upper back and shoulder pain.

157
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,642
It can even lead to headaches.

158
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,168
So, what makes this bra different?

159
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,204
- It can never go bad.
- What do you mean?

160
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,890
Tiny elements of fisilca rub together

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,527
to prevent the fabric from resting too long
in any one position.

162
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,120
It's a living bra.

163
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,483
The effect would be rather like
having a large pair of man's hands

164
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,524
holding the breasts in position.

165
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,530
But the bra will go bad.
All bras go bad.

166
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,929
Not this one, Jen. But don't take
my word for it - take it out for a spin.

167
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,364
- So what's it called?
- I call it.. the Abracadabra!

168
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,801
- You are kidding me.
- No.

169
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,524
You're really going on <i>Dragons' Den?</i>

170
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,770
I've got an interview today
with the producers at the BBC.

171
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,770
Oh, that is just huge.
You're gonna be on telly.

172
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,611
I know, but you've got to keep this
under your respective hats.

173
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,690
So if anyone asks for me,
my name is Stephen Jennel.

174
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,326
- Why Stephen Jennel?
- If my calculations are correct,

175
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,091
this could be the only bra
a woman need ever buy.

176
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,931
Do you know what Playtex would do to me
if they knew about the Abracadabra?

177
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,489
- What would they do?
- They would kill me, Jen.

178
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,409
I don't know if they'd kill you, Moss.

179
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,524
Playtex have changed a lot
over the last few years.

180
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,086
Nonetheless,
I want complete secrecy on this one,

181
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,921
so if anyone asks for me,
my name is Stephen Fennel.

182
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,249
I chose Stephen Fennel
because it's easy to remember.

183
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,002
Right. Except, well, you did say
Stephen Jennel earlier.

184
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,885
Smoke and mirrors, Roy.
Is it Fennel, is it Jennel?

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,048
If I don't know, how will they?

186
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,087
Who am I, Roy? I'm a ghost.
I'm a shadow. I'm gone. Pfffff!

187
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,367
Hello, Moss speaking.

188
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,962
Well done. Good presentation.

189
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,206
Thanks, James.

190
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,402
Jen, a word.

191
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,281
I've got Helen Buley coming in tomorrow.
Do you know who she is?

192
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,401
Of course I do.

193
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,081
She's been made head of BHDR Industries,
so obviously we need to make friends.

194
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,726
I know. BHDR Industries,

195
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,605
they're the top makers of that product
that has something to do with our company.

196
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,008
Exactly.
I want you up front at that meeting.

197
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,841
We can't have Helen going back to BHDR
saying Reynholm Industries is a boys' club.

198
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,610
- How does that sound?
- Oh, sounds great.

199
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,087
All right, see you tomorrow.

200
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,810
Stephen Premel.

201
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,129
Oh, hello. Yeah, I'm Stephen Premel.

202
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,881
- I think.
- You're very late. Quick.

203
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,487
Hello. Stephen Premel.
I'm afraid I'm very late.

204
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,484
Um, what exactly, um, is...?

205
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,648
Um... Yep...

206
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,923
Gavin Briers there,
with developments in North Korea.

207
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,964
It's five years since
the war in Iraq began.

208
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,130
The conflict rages on
with no hope of a solution in sight.

209
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,211
I'm joined by Stephen Premel,
a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence.

210
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,448
- Mr Premel...
- Hello. Hello.

211
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,963
Uh, Iraq is a gigantic
and bloody mess, isn't it?

212
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,889
Yes.

213
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,962
- Well, how do you explain it?
- Well, we shouldn't have gone to war.

214
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,527
- You think the invasion was a mistake?
- Oh, yes.

215
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,608
I'm astonished that you should
agree to this so readily

216
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,405
when your department
must take a lot of the blame.

217
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,045
What? We didn't do anything.

218
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,484
Well, you raised no objection
in the run-up to the war.

219
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,365
Yes, I did. I signed a petition.

220
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,527
Sorry?

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,641
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
When can I start talking about my bra?

222
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,768
Oh, Jen, can you bring me the prototype?

223
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,042
There are a couple of glitches
I need to iron out.

224
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,607
Sure. Guess who I'm about to meet now.

225
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,202
Helen Buley.

226
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,526
Oh, come on.

227
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,565
She took that football team to court for
institutional sexism, won massive damages,

228
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,126
and now she's head CEO at BHDR Industries.

229
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,802
Sorry, I kinda switched off
after the word "football".

230
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,968
Did you see it? Did you see it? Is he in?

231
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,606
Is he...? Aaah, ha-ha!

232
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,528
There I am,

233
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,405
catching up with the
news events of the day,

234
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,286
when who should appear
upon my television screen?

235
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,006
It's only the Ministry of Defence.

236
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,684
Oh, the news, <i>Dragons' Den</i> -
you're all over the schedules.

237
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,521
I'm sorry, Moss, but are you really sure
that you're ready to go on <i>Dragons' Den?</i>

238
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,769
- Yes. It's a brilliant product.
- Oh, no. Don't get me wrong.

239
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,090
You have got the science down, but it's...
well, it's all the other stuff, isn't it?

240
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,680
- What other stuff?
- OK, well...

241
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,328
OK, let's say this staple is science.

242
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,771
You're good at this.

243
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,486
What you're not so good at...

244
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,921
is everything else in the world.

245
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,885
But that's where I come in.
I can help you with all this other stuff,

246
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,322
you know, give you some tips
on business and presentation,

247
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,206
leaving you free to concentrate on this.

248
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,005
- What's in it for you?
- A cut.

249
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,522
- All right, you're in for half a percent.
- Oh!

250
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,802
25%.

251
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,605
Half a percent.

252
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,609
Deal.

253
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,601
OK, first thing we need to do is buy the
rights for the word "Abracadabra".

254
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,327
Agreed, but before that we've got to
sort out the overheating problem.

255
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,680
"Overheating problem"?

256
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,771
Yes, it's got a very, very serious
overheating problem.

257
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,091
I'll have it sorted by next week, though.
Just need to get it back off Jen.

258
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,329
Which has led to
significant gains in this area

259
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,161
and an overall yield of 22%.

260
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,405
Thank you very much. Jen, is it?

261
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,124
Yes, Miss Buley.

262
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,401
Please. Helen.

263
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,488
Uh-huh. OK, Helen.

264
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,970
I think as the only two women in the room we
can dispense with formalities, don't you?

265
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,526
Reynholm Industries has come a long way
in the past two years

266
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,530
if a young woman like this
can blossom within its walls.

267
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,291
I remember when the atmosphere here
was a lot less conducive

268
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,564
to what I can remember one executive
calling "working skirt".

269
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,480
Yes, well, I think we're all a little older
and a little wiser now, Helen.

270
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,331
One would hope so.

271
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,248
Are you OK, Jen?

272
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,727
My tits.

273
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,402
Oh! Ooh! Ohhh!

274
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,522
Oh, my tits are hot.

275
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,086
Oh! Oh, they're really, really hot.

276
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,204
Ohh! Oh, my tits are on fire.

277
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,166
Yep, my tits are on fire.
They are on fire. My tits are on fire!

278
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,009
Oh! Aargh!

279
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,043
Oh, yeah! You're right.

280
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,769
- 40%.
- 20%.

281
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,291
- 40.
- 40?

282
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,765
You owe me, Moss.

283
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,602
Helen Buley has gone away
thinking I was a stripper,

284
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,563
hired as a prank.

285
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,047
But 40%, Jen, be reasonable.

286
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,562
I have two black rings around here.

287
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,923
- I could sue you and get everything.
- All right, all right.

288
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,203
Good, thank you. Now we can
concentrate on your presentation.

289
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,482
Hey, hold on!
I'm doing presentation.

290
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,401
- Where'd you get pizza?
- Some idiot left it in the toilet.

291
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,929
I am doing presentation.

292
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,045
Whoa. No, hold on. Moss is my best friend,
and I'm damned if I'm gonna let ..

293
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,128
- Do something else.
- Like what?

294
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,163
I don't know. Fitness.

295
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,650
Fitness? People do need to be fit
to go on <i>Dragons' Den.</i>

296
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,846
Come on, Moss,
you're keeping the Dragons waiting.

297
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,405
- Wow.
- Hey.

298
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,251
- Jen, Roy.
- You look amazing.

299
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,885
Thank you.

300
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,365
You sorted out the overheating problem?

301
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,930
I'm completely sure that I've absolutely
sorted out the overheating problem, yes.

302
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,566
Unless I've made it even worse.

303
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,730
- How do you feel? Do you feel ready?
- My middle name is Ready.

304
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,401
No, that doesn't sound right.
I eat ready for breakfast.

305
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,525
OK, uh... maybe... maybe don't talk too
much. Let the product do the talking.

306
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,405
What do I do
when they want me to do the talking?

307
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,568
- You're scaring him.
- Oh, don't be scared, Moss.

308
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,808
This is one of the biggest moments
of your life coming up.

309
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,131
You cannot get nervous now, because if you
do, Moss, it'll be a disaster. A disaster!

310
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,607
- Don't! Shut up!
- I don't want to do it. I feel trapped,

311
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,882
like a moth in a bath.

312
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,448
Moss, we're already late.

313
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,687
Will you come on with me?

314
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,801
- What?
- Please.

315
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,522
Well, actually, maybe it's just the thing.

316
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,168
If Helen Buley sees it,
she'll realise I'm a proper professional,

317
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,250
and not a member of the sex industry.
Are you sure?

318
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,087
I'm positive.
You can do presentation.

319
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,646
And I'll do fitness.

320
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,491
<i>Jen, Roy and Maurice are
IT professionals with Reynholm Industries.</i>

321
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,321
<i>They walk up the stairs
and across the room.</i>

322
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,568
<i>They nod at the Dragons.</i>

323
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,765
<i>One of them</i> - <i>Maurice</i> -
<i>puts a case on a chair.</i>

324
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,407
<i>The Dragons are beside piles of money,
with pens.</i>

325
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,930
Women in the workplace...

326
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,881
- Take your time.
- Err...

327
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,968
Sorry.

328
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,564
Women working
in a workplace environment...

329
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,444
work...

330
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,928
