1
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,199
- Who owns the Infinity Gauntlet?
- Thanos.

2
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,279
- What was Thor's father's name?
- Odin.

3
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,679
Sorry, Moss,
I've really got to go.

4
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,479
Just a few more,
just a few more!

5
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,879
No, no, I'm sorry.
You've done more than enough.

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,359
OK. Alright, baby,
see you later. Bye-bye.

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,199
- Wow!
- Right?

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,159
That's an impressive knowledge
of the Marvel universe.

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,919
- I know.
- Well, you've done it.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,559
You've finally found a woman
I can do business with.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,999
Yeah, no, don't say
things like that.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,799
I'm sorry, I'm just
so excited for us!

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,643
No.

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,799
If you don't go in all the way,

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,359
it doesn't really count.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,799
Hey, Red! Stand back,
stand back, this one's mine.

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,359
I'm going to do everything
for you really nice.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,681
Stand back, stand back!
she's all mine.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,681
- It's tight.
- You're so strong.

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,880
- Oh!
- Ah, yes, yes!

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,290
It's bubbling over.

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,850
It's on the house...for you.

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,005
- Oh, my God!
- You inspire me.

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,879
- Have a great day.
- I will. And you. Thank you.

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,644
Ciao.

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,959
Maman, je suis un bébé.

27
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,999
Moss, have you seen this video
of the baby speaking French?

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,279
It went viral at 10:30, Roy.
Of course I've seen it.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,519
I must have been in the toilet.

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,039
Ah, Jen, exciting news.

31
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,879
I've just uploaded
the second episode

32
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,719
of my board games
review show.

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,324
Care to have a look?

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,599
That was fast.

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,399
Seems like only yesterday

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,119
we had to sit through
the last one.

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,759
- It was three months ago, Jen.
- Really?!

38
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,079
It feels like it just happened.
Roy, did you hear that?

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,559
Moss has done his board game
review show again.

40
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,799
I'm not watching that.
I'm not watching that again.

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,839
Jesus Christ, we don't
have to watch it, do we?

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,799
We only sat through the
first one the other day.

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,719
- It was three months ago.
- My God!

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,119
Wow. It feels like
it just ended.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,919
It was so boring!

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,404
It was like being insane,
it was so insanely boring.

47
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,284
Roy's not a fan,
but you said you liked it.

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,759
- Where did you get your coffee?
- New place.

49
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,679
- Any good?
- Really good.

50
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,039
You specifically said,
and I quote,

51
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,559
"You must show me
the next one, Moss."

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,559
- Did I? Did I really? My God.

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,479
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

54
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,999
that'll be my lady love
from the seventh floor.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,159
- That's going well?
- Oh, yeah!

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,079
He's cock-a-hoop
over this sheila.

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,319
OK, so that'll be over soon,
then.

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,999
Hey, I'll have you know that
Alice is nuts about me.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,079
She thinks that
I'm emotionally artistic.

60
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,759
What does that mean?

61
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Well, she said that emotionally
I was on the artistic spectrum.

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,119
I think it means that I'm
creative about my feelings,

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,999
and I'm more in tune with her
wants and needs than most men.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,399
Oh, she's rung out.
That keeps happening.

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,879
Alright, if I said
I'd watch it

66
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,199
then I suppose that's what
I'm going to have to do.

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,959
- That's the spirit, Jen!
- Let's get it over with.

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,599
Now, keep an open mind.

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,959
I know the first show
was a bit "bare bones"

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,639
but I think you'll really enjoy
my new episode,

71
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,439
or 'webisode', if you prefer.

72
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,239
I don't prefer that.
No-one does.

73
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,159
Come on, come on. Sooner it
starts, sooner it's over.

74
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,686
Game Board.

75
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,964
Game. Game. Game.

76
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,159
- Game.
- Board.

77
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,519
- Game.
- Board.

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,879
- Game.
- Board.

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,399
Board.

80
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,928
Board. Board. Board.

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,839
Hello and welcome
to Games Board.

82
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,159
Today on the show, we have...

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,288
So, guys...

84
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,927
What's coming up on the show?

85
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,279
- Guys?
- I've...

86
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,559
I've been playing
'Ports of Essen',

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,039
a strategic trading game
where each player

88
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,679
takes the role of a Danish
fishing port merchant

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,603
in the 16th century.

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,399
And for a change of pace,

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,919
I've been looking at

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,639
the expansion to
'Textile Merchant',

93
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,769
Norfolk Edition'.

94
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,279
Two games by Rainer Kinitski?

95
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,601
Hold onto your hat,
it's going to be a bumpy...

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,966
Let's talk about components.

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,319
Shouldn't we do rules
before components?

98
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,679
Components won't make any sense
if we do it before the rules.

99
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,479
Don't forget to cut
this conversation.

100
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,643
- What?
- Don't let the program...

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,519
How long is this?

102
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,799
Even hearing it is bad.
I need to stop hearing it.

103
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,879
Sorry, Moss, I can't do it.
It's unbearable.

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,679
Where are you going?

105
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,719
- I'm jealous of your coffee.
- You literally can't watch it?

106
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,722
I literally can't watch it.

107
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,159
So what can we do
to make it better?

108
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,599
Well, I don't want to
say anything

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,479
that might hurt your feelings.

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,119
It's alright, I can take it,
Jen. I'm a big boy.

111
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,879
Well, as I say, it's slow.
It's so slow.

112
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,279
OK, good. It is a bit slow.
We can work on that.

113
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,204
And I guess the other thing
is that it's terrible.

114
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,119
It's slow and terrible.

115
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,759
If a friend asked me,

116
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,719
I'd say it's a slow,
terrible thing

117
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,639
I could only watch
for a minute.

118
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,119
Is this helpful?

119
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,479
Oh! So helpful!

120
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,919
God! "Slow. Terrible.

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,479
"Could only watch it
for a minute."

122
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,199
A lot to get our teeth
stuck into.

123
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,239
Let's see if I can help you
with anything else.

124
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,759
Erm, none of you are any good
in front of a camera.

125
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,399
- None of us. Yeah.
- You've got annoying voices.

126
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,959
The voices are a pain.

127
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,119
And I guess that's because
you haven't got any confidence.

128
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,599
No confidence.

129
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,559
If there's one thing you need,
it's confidence.

130
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,159
It is confidence. Absolutely.

131
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,199
Well, Jen, I can only
thank you, once again...

132
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,282
- And another thing...
- I'm not listening anymore!

133
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,359
- Douglas, you're incorrigible.
- I'm incorrigible?

134
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,079
You're Raymond Peterfellow,

135
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,079
owner of the finest lap-dancing
establishment in Soho.

136
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,399
If anyone's incorrigible it's
you, you perfumed porno vampire.

137
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,319
Perfumed porno
vampire. I like that.

138
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,959
So you're thinking of 500 of
these travelling across London?

139
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,199
- That's what I said.
- Sexy and classy.

140
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,399
And that's difficult
to pull off.

141
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,679
This will get people talking,
alright. Ha!

142
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,439
Consider me
one happy shareholder.

143
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,519
Right. Oh, big party coming up
on Thursday night

144
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,999
if you're up for it.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,039
Damn, I'm supposed to be doing
'Secret Millionaire'.

146
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,799
Fuck it, I'll cancel.
I'll tell my assistant.

147
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,279
- Hi, Joan.
- Jen.

148
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,119
I'm not your assistant,
Mr Reynholm.

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,119
I want you to cancel
'Secret Millionaire'.

150
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,239
Not your assistant.
Wouldn't know who to call.

151
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,559
Just say anything.
Work your usual magic.

152
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,961
Not your assistant.
I am not your...

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,199
I thought this was the toilet.
Didn't this used to be toilets?

154
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,761
Yes. I moved my office here to
be closer to the ladies toilets.

155
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,319
Must get someone
to take that sign down.

156
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,519
What's wrong with you, Ross?

157
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,719
- Small mocha, please.
- Small mocha, please.

158
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,006
Okey-dokey.

159
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,802
Or...medium.

160
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,439
You know what? I've changed
my mind. I'll have a medium.

161
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,965
So you don't want a small one?

162
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,199
Small's fine. Small's good,
just as good, so I'll just...

163
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,799
Yes, that is what I'll have -
a small mocha, my little man.

164
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,119
My good man. My good little man.

165
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,168
OK, coming up.

166
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,489
Got it.

167
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,447
OK?

168
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,364
Fuck's sake.

169
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,089
Thank you for
the virgin gin and tonic.

170
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,079
I suppose you could
just call it 'tonic'.

171
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,999
Yes.

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,319
So, Ross, how goes it
in the world of computers?

173
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,926
Or PC world, if you will?

174
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,839
We're all very happy,
thank you, Mr Reynholm.

175
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,639
Very happy indeed.

176
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,479
Forget this 'we' malarky,
I'm talking to you, Ross.

177
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,279
Are you happy?

178
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,879
Very happy,
thank you, Mr Reynholm.

179
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,759
Look, I'm not your boss.

180
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,839
We're just a couple of guys
shooting the shit.

181
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,639
Now, tell me the truth.

182
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,879
Well, I suppose sometimes

183
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,479
I do feel I lack
a little confidence.

184
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,119
-- I know, it's silly.

185
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,203
No, I've just realised
what a funny voice you have.

186
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,359
Now, Ross, I'm going to
tell you something.

187
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,679
Confidence
is a confidence trick.

188
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,490
Look at me. What do you see?

189
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,559
A man who inherited his
father's successful business.

190
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,159
- Wasn't that successful.
- It was pretty successful.

191
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,719
A lot more successful than
it is now, that's for sure.

192
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,319
Alright, alright!
Just say the right thing.

193
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,199
Say the thing I want you to say.

194
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,639
- Say "a confident man".
- A confident man!

195
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,439
I wasn't always this way.

196
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,519
I was just like you, but then
I discovered the secret.

197
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,599
And Ross, I'm going to tell you
what that secret is,

198
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,799
but you must keep it
to yourself.

199
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,485
I will take my ears
to the grave.

200
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,405
Two words.

201
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,690
Women's slacks.

202
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,479
I'm sorry?

203
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,323
Women's slacks.

204
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,039
- Women's slacks?
- Yes.

205
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,169
I'm wearing women's slacks.

206
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,730
- You're wearing women's slacks?
- Yes.

207
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,399
That's nothing like what I
thought you were going to say.

208
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,879
- Is it not?
- It is not.

209
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,879
I thought you were going to
give me a book recommendation.

210
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,885
Book recommendation?
I can't read.

211
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,719
I don't know what it is,

212
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,039
but women's slacks give me
the confidence I need

213
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,999
to survive
in a tough business world.

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,879
They're lighter, airier and less
constricted than men's trousers,

215
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,201
and I'm pretty sure it doesn't
make me a transvestite.

216
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,199
Look at that shit. Look at it.

217
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,999
I can't...
How am I supposed to...

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,839
It looks like
he milked a cow over it.

219
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,799
You're so fussy about coffee.
It's very annoying.

220
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,759
It's ruined!
He ruined my coffee.

221
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,279
Don't just chuck it like that.

222
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,199
That fella shouldn't be allowed
to be a barista.

223
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,879
- Why not?
- Because he's too small, Jen.

224
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,281
He's clearly too small
to be a barista.

225
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,726
What?

226
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,645
You're being a bit of
a small person racist, Roy.

227
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,359
A small person racist?
That's not a thing.

228
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,879
You can't have tiny baristas,
Jen.

229
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,326
For God's sake,
the man works with steam!

230
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,799
I'm going to have to
have a word with him.

231
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,999
Have a word with him?

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,606
- That's right.
- About his height?

233
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,519
I think he'd appreciate
the feedback.

234
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,119
About his height?

235
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,519
That's not what people do, Roy.

236
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,359
Well, I'm not people, Jen,
and I think that's a good thing.

237
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,079
I'm not afraid to cut through
the bullshit.

238
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,279
I bet this is exactly what
Alice was talking about.

239
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,559
Autistic!

240
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,245
She said 'autistic'.
That's what happened.

241
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,039
- No, I don't think so.
- There's no artistic spectrum!

242
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,963
But she said I was...

243
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,159
Did she say it during
an argument, by any chance?

244
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,679
She did say it during a...
She did say it...

245
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,999
What was weird was, we were
having quite a big argument,

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,199
and then suddenly,
out of nowhere,

247
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,279
she paid me
that lovely compliment.

248
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,244
Hey, baby.

249
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,484
Oh, oh, good, good, yes.

250
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,199
Sure, yeah, I'd love to.

251
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,806
Yes, OK, well,
I'll see you there.

252
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,285
Wh... Why?

253
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,799
No, it's...

254
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,802
Hello? Alice?

255
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,879
- That was weird.
- What?

256
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,119
OK, so, what the hell is that?

257
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,719
So she tells me
that her grandfather died,

258
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,319
she wants me
to go to the funeral.

259
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,800
I say that I'd be delighted,
and then she hangs on me.

260
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,239
- Her grandfather's funeral?
- Yeah.

261
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,479
That's what you were
just talking about just there?

262
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,279
That's right.

263
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,799
You sounded like you were being
invited to Glastonbury.

264
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,119
Oh, funerals are sad.

265
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,159
- You did not sound sad.
- I wasn't concentrating!

266
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,079
Emotionally artistic? You're
emotionally colourblind.

267
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,719
Maybe I am emotionally
colourblind.

268
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,879
I was about to confront
that little man.

269
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,479
I was going to give him shit
about his height.

270
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,679
Glad you realise how
inappropriate that would be.

271
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,127
Yeah.
I'll just leave him a note.

272
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,811
- I'm here on purpose.
- Oh, yes.

273
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,639
I'm interested
in women's slacks.

274
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,759
I see.

275
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,967
I'd like... Sorry. Hot ear.

276
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,361
I'd like to buy a pair
of women's slacks.

277
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,239
For me, not for a woman.

278
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,279
Oh, yes, well,
that shouldn't be a problem.

279
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,999
I'm not trying to
look like a woman.

280
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,445
I understand.

281
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,359
I'm not a confident man.

282
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,048
Quite. Well, let's see
what we can do for you.

283
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,079
- I don't know about this.
- Oh, just ask them, Jen.

284
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,839
Me and Juan, we have a thing.

285
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,759
I don't want another
splishy-splashy coffee

286
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,679
from the teeny-tiny
coffee man!

287
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,479
Poor woman.

288
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,679
Don't give her money.
You're not supposed to do that.

289
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,207
I'm actually a person,
Roy, with human feelings.

290
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,919
- Oh.
- Oh.

291
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,519
- Oh!
- Oh?

292
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,279
- Whadya do that for?
- I'm sorry, I thought...

293
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,479
-- I don't know what to do.

294
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,199
- Here's £5. Do you want £5?

295
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,959
- I don't know if you want money.

296
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,799
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry!
- Arggh!

297
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,119
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- What happened?

298
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,079
Never mind, just go.

299
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,559
What do you think?

300
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,608
I think...

301
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,688
...you just sold a brother
some slacks.

302
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,119
Help! Help, get off me!

303
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,559
- Let go!
- You're a bully.

304
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,849
Need to save that old
woman, but I have no confidence.

305
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,405
Hey.

306
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,765
Thank you.

307
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,400
Red! Come on, no queue for you.
Come on.

308
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,124
- Hello, Juan.
- I'm with her.

309
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,559
It must be my birthday, I get
to see you twice so quick.

310
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,039
Yes, back again!
Same as usual, please.

311
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,879
And could I ask you
a huge favour

312
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,679
and ask you to make
Roy's coffee too?

313
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,079
I've been going on and on
about you.

314
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,879
And I like what I heard.

315
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,319
- Would that be OK? Do you mind?
- Anything for you, my sweet.

316
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,243
OK.

317
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,250
Slippery fingers.

318
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,759
- It's alright.
- It's not alright.

319
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,719
Look, it looks like me
with a beard.

320
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,291
I don't want this.
It's horrible.

321
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,879
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

322
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,479
- Why did you do that?!
- I didn't mean to!

323
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,799
I don't hate you.
None of this is on purpose.

324
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,799
What can I do?
Let me give you some money.

325
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,279
Here's £10. Oh, my God!

326
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,327
Huh?

327
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,919
- I'm not with her.
- Oi! Oi!

328
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,399
Jesus!

329
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,199
- Did you write this comment?
- No.

330
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,319
You've got a problem
with smaller people.

331
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,559
I don't have a problem with
small people, OK? I don't.

332
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,519
I just don't want you
making my coffee.

333
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,719
Because you're bad at it.
You're bad at making coffee.

334
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,599
You're too small. You're too
small to make good coffee.

335
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,331
- You know what? Up yours.
- No...

336
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,999
- Little man, watch out!

337
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,319
It's being called
the viral video of the year.

338
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,239
A woman throws her coffee
onto a tramp

339
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,439
and then a man has an argument
with a small barista.

340
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,044
You're just too small!

341
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,039
The barista
goes to cross the road

342
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,929
and is hit by a van
with breasts.

343
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,439
The woman who's been dubbed
by various online commentators

344
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,879
as Coffee Tramp Toss Bitch
has not been identified,

345
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,566
while the man known as
Small Person Racist was also...

346
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,761
Small people are not a race.
This isn't 'Game of Thrones'.

347
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,799
They're actually calling me
a bitch on the news.

348
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,959
What the hell happened there?

349
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,679
- How did you find out?
- Weekly surveillance report.

350
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,759
What's going on, Joan?

351
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,279
I expect better
from my assistant.

352
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,319
I'm not your assistant.
My name isn't Joan.

353
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,839
What's your beef
with the homeless?

354
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,359
I don't have any homeless beef.

355
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,159
Ah, so it's women you hate.
Well, that I can understand.

356
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,519
Whoa. You record our emails
and tape our phone calls?

357
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,159
Alright, dry your eyes, Bono.

358
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,839
If you've nothing to hide,
you've nothing to fear.

359
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,559
It wasn't my fault,
Mr Reynholm.

360
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,199
I would never throw coffee
over a homeless woman.

361
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,879
And I would never
abuse a small person.

362
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,770
Certainly not enough to make
a van with tits hit him.

363
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,719
Although I suppose
I sort of did.

364
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,439
I sort of did my one too.

365
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,239
Frustrating that we did
both of our things.

366
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,719
Yes, it is.

367
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,239
Alright, spare me.
I was young once.

368
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,079
But if this gets out,

369
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,239
this could deeply damage
Reynholm Industries' ability

370
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,679
to make that product
that we make.

371
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,999
What do you want us
to do, Mr Reynholm?

372
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,799
Don't do anything.

373
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,359
Stay out of trouble,
and remember,

374
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,524
there are places
lower than the basement.

375
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,799
Stop worrying, Jen. Nobody can
make us out in that video.

376
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,839
It's just like early footage
of happy slapping. Just relax.

377
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,279
I can't relax. It's alright
for you. I have plans.

378
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,879
I want to get up there.
I will not be a social piranha.

379
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,484
A what, now?

380
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,679
- Jen, take a look at this.
- What is it?

381
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,239
- The new-look 'Game Board'.
-200,000 views?

382
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,844
I know. It's a bit different.

383
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,759
- Check it out. Game Board.
- Shut the fridge. It's...

384
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,331
- Game Board.
----- Game Board.

385
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,845
Say what?

386
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,039
Wow! You all
seem different somehow.

387
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,008
Yes. We're all wearing
women's trousers.

388
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,799
Oh. Right.

389
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,039
Hey, what's going on?
It's G-G-G-G-Game Board.

390
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,559
- He's...
- Newton Sinclair.

391
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,642
- This guy's...
- Roger Booth.

392
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,679
And I guess
I'm still Maurice Moss.

393
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,919
Are you wearing
the trousers now?

394
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,999
I couldn't wear them all the
time. I'd have a heart attack.

395
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,085
No, they're safely locked away
in my fortress of solitude.

396
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,799
It's funny - when I wear them,
I'm a dynamo,

397
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,279
a young Leonard Kravitz, people
hanging off my every word.

398
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,999
And then as soon as
I take them off

399
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,119
I'm just back to being
the same...

400
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,919
She's gone, hasn't she?
She's gone.

401
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,719
- She went quite a while ago.
- Yeah.

402
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,719
- Oh, Michael Bublé's here!
- No, no, it's a funeral, Moss.

403
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,479
I have to go to this funeral
for Alice's grandfather,

404
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,359
and I'm not looking forward
to it.

405
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,599
Funerals are pain in the crack.

406
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,639
Even in the best of
circumstances they're no picnic,

407
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,439
but now I've got Alice on my
arse like the emotion police.

408
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,919
So I'm going to have to look
convincingly sad

409
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,639
for the majority of the day.

410
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,919
Eugh.

411
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,119
She's not going to expect me
to cry, is she?

412
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,599
- No.
- What if she does?!

413
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,199
I can't cry on cue.
What do I do then?

414
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,119
Do what I do
when I need to cry.

415
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,441
Use a mild pepper spray
solution.

416
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,959
Now, that makes sense, see?

417
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,599
That makes more sense
than having to feel something.

418
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,599
Do you have
any of that stuff here?

419
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,439
Why do you think
we have a mini-fridge?

420
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,169
Good evening.

421
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,359
- You've got quite a lot of it.
- I suppose I have made a lot.

422
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,479
And what's in here?

423
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,359
Just Tabasco, wasabi
and a bit of tear gas.

424
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,479
Those sound like bad things
to put in your eyes.

425
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,639
It's extremely mild.
It's mainly water.

426
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,079
- I'll take it as a last resort.
- As a last resort.

427
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,359
In case I find myself
out of my emotional depth.

428
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,159
- There you go.
- Alright. Thanks, Moss.

429
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,605
-'Bye.
-'Bye.

430
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,406
Oh, don't forget
to add the water.

431
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,159
- Oh, poor Pip Pop.
- Sorry, what?

432
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,959
Pip Pop.

433
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,442
We always called him Pip Pop
because he was so short.

434
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,399
All of my family on that side
are really short.

435
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,801
Is that right?

436
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,730
Ohhh. Oh, Alice. Shh.

437
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,959
Oh!

438
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
- Roy, are you alright?
- Holy...

439
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,919
- Yeah, it just really hurts.
- Oh, Roy.

440
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,003
- Oh, it hurts.
- I know. I know.

441
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,841
Oh, Christ,
why is this happening?

442
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,239
So will we ever find out
just who this person was?

443
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,039
Unfortunately,
with current technology,

444
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,519
we can't de-pixelate the
picture, so it's very unlikely

445
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,519
we'll ever find out
the identity

446
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,921
of this dreadful ginger cow

447
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,519
- Christ. What the f...
- Oh, are you still crying?

448
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,479
I don't seem to be able to stop.
What's happening now?

449
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,879
One of the pallbearers
wasn't able to make it.

450
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,039
- Oh.
- I know this is a bit weird.

451
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,919
Do you mind stepping in?

452
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,719
- I'm happy to.
- Thank you.

453
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,319
I mean, I'm sadly happy to,
yeah.

454
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,119
That's fine.

455
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,719
Hi, thanks so much
for helping us out.

456
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,199
No problemo. Hey. Hi there.

457
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,039
Hello. Oh, there's another one.

458
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,839
Hi. Are these the
other pallbearers?

459
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,639
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

460
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,719
So you guys and me, we're going
to carry the coffin together?

461
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,999
Yes.

462
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,559
We're going to put the casket
on our collective shoulders

463
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,199
and walk in a straight line
with it?

464
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,599
No, it didn't go well, Jen.
It didn't go well at all.

465
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,279
I mean, thanks for asking,
but no, it wasn't a success.

466
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,079
It wasn't a successful funeral
for me.

467
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,599
Didn't have
the required gravitas.

468
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,599
- Gravitas? No, no.
- It wasn't very dignified.

469
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,239
It wasn't dignified at all, Jen!

470
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,839
If I had to pick a word

471
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,959
to describe Pip Pop's final
journey to the grave,

472
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,679
it would be 'funny'.

473
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,799
It was so funny, Jen.

474
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,439
Of course, I tried not to laugh

475
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,519
and I tried to put
other things in my head,

476
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,679
but every step that we took
was a fresh reminder

477
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,559
of just how funny
the whole thing was!

478
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,167
- You didn't laugh, did you?
- I laughed my hole off!

479
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,199
I can't believe
she's still with you.

480
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,079
I suppose, but, I mean, I'm
hanging on by a thread, Jen.

481
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,519
I'll get through it as long as
nothing else bad happens.

482
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,407
There's the phone now.

483
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,359
The new footage has led
to the pair being identified -

484
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,159
Jen Barber and Roy Trenneman,

485
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,049
both employees
at Reynholm Industries.

486
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,999
What the hell
were you thinking?

487
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,005
I told you to keep a low
profile and you do it again!

488
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,639
No, no, no, no, no, it's new
footage, Mr Reynholm.

489
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,839
Bum your excuses!

490
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,479
Reynholm Industries
has a reputation to uphold.

491
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,245
We're not News International,
for Christ's sake!

492
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,199
I'm going to have to do 'Secret
pissing Millionaire' now

493
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,079
just to undo your damage!

494
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,239
And I'm missing out
on a massive tit party!

495
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,846
And you're no longer
my assistant.

496
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,284
I'm furious.

497
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,439
And I'll tell you
something else,

498
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,807
when I return from the estate,
it's...

499
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,085
...for you.

500
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,999
-- Oh! Oh!

501
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,239
Hey, baby.

502
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,879
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, no, absolutely.

503
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,644
Alright, OK. Bye-bye.

504
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,688
- She left you?
- She did. Yeah.

505
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,639
As the identities
of Coffee Toss Tramp Bitch

506
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,799
and Small Person Racist
are finally revealed,

507
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,679
we at Channel 4 News ask,

508
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,839
"What the hell
is wrong with people?"

509
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,679
I've got a lot of new
followers on Chitter.

510
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,759
- Loads more followers, yeah.
- They're all very abusive.

511
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,039
- They wish we were dead.
- Wait.

512
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,839
- What?
- Chitter.

513
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,731
We can use Chitter
to explain ourselves.

514
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,799
Yeah.

515
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,319
Chitter is the perfect place
to explain a complex situation.

516
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,279
"I didn't mean to throw coffee
on that woman.

517
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,239
"I didn't know she was there.

518
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,719
"I went back to try
and find her, but..."

519
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,159
- Too many characters.
- Too many characters.

520
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,079
Got it. "Hate the homeless?

521
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,639
"And I suppose
I hate women too.

522
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,239
"LOL." Send.

523
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,279
Whoa. You didn't
just send that, did you?

524
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,959
- Yes.
- That didn't sound so good.

525
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,519
People get the sense of it.
That's the thing about Chitter.

526
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,439
It's best if you're
conversational, off the cuff.

527
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,919
Here it is.

528
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,319
Oh. You didn't put a question
mark after the first sentence.

529
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,599
You don't need to use
proper grammar on Chitter, Roy.

530
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,879
What you've chitted here,
Jen, is

531
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,880
"Hate the homeless and I suppose
I hate women too. LOL."

532
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,921
Phew!
I'm glad all that's over.

533
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,126
Ohhhhh.

534
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,770
And then
laughs about it on Chitter.

535
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,759
You're too small.
You're just too small!

536
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,047
You're too small,
too small, too small...

537
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,609
...which then leads to him
being hit by a van with tits.

538
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:42,560
And now Anonymous are after us.
Well, that's just ideal.

539
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,399
Oh, a bunch of nerds sitting
at their computer,

540
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,279
what can they do?

541
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,199
We pissed off the internet, Jen.

542
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,119
The internet
is coming to get us!

543
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Well, let's get it
before it gets us.

544
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,959
What are you...

545
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,919
Oh, I don't want
Anonymous after me.

546
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,719
I'm in Anonymous!

547
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,165
I think.

548
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,969
Let's hide it!

549
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,759
- What?
- The internet!

550
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,444
Oh.

551
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,079
Because we told you that
that was the internet?

552
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,923
Yes.

553
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,601
And we never told you
that it wasn't the internet?

554
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,847
- No.
- Well, the thing is, Jen...

555
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,323
That's not the internet.

556
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,124
What's Jen doing
with the internet?

557
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,806
- We're not doing that.
- Oh!

558
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,286
Crickets!

559
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,359
Right, don't be scared, yeah?
We're all friends here.

560
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,119
- Tell Dougie your story.
- OK, but who is he again?

561
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,519
I'm just your average
social worker.

562
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,879
Yes, just in the area
having a look around.

563
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,359
Please, just pretend
I'm not here.

564
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,239
Do you ever have anyone come
round and help you and stuff?

565
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,479
Grandad, sometimes,
but he's hardly around.

566
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,759
- What about your dad?
- He's never around either.

567
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,519
Sorry, I have to stop you there.
I must take this.

568
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,487
Reynholm.

569
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,439
What? Well, increase the bid.

570
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,479
I don't care what I said
the ceiling was.

571
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,131
I want that artwork by Madonna.

572
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,159
No, 22 million is the minimum,
but I'm happy to go to 50.

573
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,369
In fact, make 50
the new minimum. Yes, yes.

574
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,206
I can't talk right now.
I'm doing 'Secret Millionaire'.

575
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,119
That's very sad.

576
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,079
Do you want to shut up? We're
filming 'Secret Millionaire'.

577
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,082
Check your privilege.

578
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,279
How am I finding it so far?

579
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,279
To be honest with you,
it's not as God-awful

580
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,759
as I thought it would be.

581
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,279
The people have been terribly
nice, actually quite clean.

582
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,799
And I have been invited
to a party this evening.

583
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,639
The last party I ever went to

584
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,479
was when EIton John's dog
had a baby.

585
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,799
I tell a lie.

586
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,559
The last party I went to was
when Conrad Black got arrested.

587
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,199
Conrad Black, who's that?

588
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,599
Oh, no-one, just an old friend.
Let's get in there!

589
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,045
Yeah, sure.

590
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,559
So I thought with 'Game Board's
increased viewership,

591
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,719
perhaps it would be a good place
to put my side of the story

592
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,519
and show the world

593
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,359
I'm not the monster
I'm currently supposed to be.

594
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,759
- Boo! Boo!
- Could you not boo me, please?

595
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,808
And that is a horrible T-shirt.

596
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,839
So the question
everyone's asking -

597
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,519
Jen Barber, do you hate women?

598
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,439
Oh.

599
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,839
- Thank you, Jen Barber.
- No...

600
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,919
Coming up, what was it like

601
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,879
to be a 14th-century
grain merchant?

602
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,119
- I don't know if that was clear.
- Sorry, it's these trousers.

603
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,199
They make me want to move
onto the next item.

604
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,799
It's better broadcasting,
and the slacks know it!

605
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,039
- Coming up...
- Stop saying "coming up".

606
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,804
I don't know
if I made my point!

607
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,959
Oh, gosh!

608
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,399
Oh!

609
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,925
Oh, gosh.

610
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,319
Richmond, do you work here
or not?

611
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,679
I don't get paid,
but I like to come in.

612
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,759
So that Goth 2 Boss thing
didn't work out?

613
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,445
Does it look like
it worked out?

614
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,999
Anyway, how have you guys been?

615
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,439
Everyone thinks
I'm a misogynist,

616
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,039
Roy lost his girlfriend because
he's emotionally colourblind

617
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,519
and Moss is wearing trousers
that make him good at telly.

618
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,439
Any gossip?

619
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,719
So, what's going on with you?

620
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,166
Oh, you know, keeping busy.
Voice-over work mainly.

621
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,639
Really? How did that happen?

622
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,007
Someone just noticed
I had a beautiful voice.

623
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,279
Oh, Richmond.
Things aren't going well at all.

624
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,519
Just get in there.

625
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,959
It's just not the same
when you guys aren't together.

626
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,042
Anyway, if you want me,
you know where I am.

627
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,888
I don't, though, Richmond.
Don't lurk!

628
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,239
Where did he go?

629
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,641
Where did who go?

630
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,199
Does it ever seem to you that
the things that happen to us

631
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,079
are sort of...strange?

632
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,199
How so, Roy?

633
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Well, remember when I had to
pretend to be disabled

634
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,319
and I ended up in Manchester?

635
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,599
That wasn't a normal thing
to happen, was it?

636
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,039
Or when you ended up
spending the night

637
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,879
in that arcade machine.

638
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,359
That was odd.

639
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,119
I suppose those were
unusual events.

640
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,919
And this is strange.

641
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,679
What's happening to us
right now is strange, isn't it?

642
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,039
Well, at least
it'll all be over soon.

643
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,079
Douglas is bound to fire us
when he gets back.

644
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,799
Come on, guys, this isn't us.

645
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,039
Are we just going to sit here
and take it?

646
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,479
What do we normally do
when we get into a scrape?

647
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,919
We normally make things worse
and worse and then it ends.

648
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,919
- No, we stick together.
- That doesn't sound like us.

649
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,719
Don't know where
you're getting that from.

650
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,679
Who are we? Who are we?
I want to hear you say it!

651
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,839
- We're the IT...
- We're the IT Department.

652
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,719
You're goddamn right we are!

653
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,119
- Are those women's slacks?
- Yes.

654
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,088
This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

655
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,439
Let's get into a car
and cruise around.

656
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,331
How do we get into a car?
Smash a window. Great idea!

657
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,159
That's the one!

658
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,245
I'm such an idiot.
I've got a robot hand!

659
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,087
Hang on a second.
This is my car!

660
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,279
Oh, shit. Whoa. It's alright,
everyone, be cool.

661
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,248
I'll handle this. Take that.

662
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,287
It's alright, officer, I'm
doing 'Secret Millionaire'.

663
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,079
Come on, come on, come on,
people. What's going on?

664
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,879
Come on, come on,
come on, people.

665
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,679
How long has he been wearing
the trousers?

666
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,159
- He won't take them off.
- OK, come on, come on, come on.

667
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,959
What's going on?

668
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,759
We don't know what's happening.

669
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,959
To every problem there's a
solution. What's our problem?

670
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,879
Everyone thinks I'm a cow
who hates women.

671
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,239
You're a cow, that's right.

672
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,879
A terrible cow. Women, OK.
Roy, hurt me.

673
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,959
The woman I love thinks
that I hate small people.

674
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,959
Small people. Thank you, Roy.

675
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,919
I'll probably die alone in
front of computer pornography.

676
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,490
I'll just draw a sad face.

677
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,800
OK, so what do women
and small people both like?

678
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,079
What do they both like?

679
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,039
- Chairs.
- Films.

680
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,679
I really don't know.

681
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,239
I'll tell you.

682
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,319
It's just they seem like
very different groups.

683
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,368
Not being attacked.

684
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,959
They both love
not being attacked.

685
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,799
Well, I can't speak
for small people, obviously,

686
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,159
but as a woman, I certainly
like not being attacked.

687
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,159
Where are you going with this,
Moss?

688
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,839
I'll tell you exactly
where I'm going with this, Roy.

689
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,279
I'm saying we use this brief
window, while Douglas is away,

690
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,319
to produce a pepper spray
solution for small women

691
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,639
using that stuff
I gave Roy earlier.

692
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,479
That sounds really weird.

693
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,799
Jen Barber,
not a hater of women,

694
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,159
but their defender,
their champion.

695
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,959
I love it now!

696
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,959
And I can do
a massive presentation.

697
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,879
A self-defence pepper spray
for small women

698
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,719
suits my purposes also!

699
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,319
It will show Alice that I care

700
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,879
and, as a woman
with small relatives,

701
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,439
she's sure to come to
Jen's presentation.

702
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,839
You know, when I first
stocked that mini-fridge

703
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,639
with pepper spray solution,

704
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,079
I thought I'd made too much,
but only now do I realise

705
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,801
that I'd made exactly the right
amount for our current purposes.

706
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,799
It almost seems like
it's too good an idea.

707
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,839
You see what we can do
when we work together?

708
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,679
With my business acumen...

709
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,206
- My scientific know-how...
- And I'm also here.

710
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,479
- We can do anything!
- Yeah!

711
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,244
I need a trouser break.

712
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,199
You coming, Roy?

713
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,759
I can't seem to get the wording
of this speech to Alice right.

714
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,559
- You're doing a speech?
- Yeah.

715
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,159
I need to show her that I'm
not emotionally colourblind.

716
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,439
I'm a very sensitive human man,
and she needs to know that.

717
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,445
Oooh, what's a more romantic
word for 'knockers'?

718
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,359
A more romantic word?

719
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,519
Come on, guys.
Let's protect women.

720
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,319
- I'll meet you up there.
- Good luck.

721
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,651
Thanks.

722
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,599
'Eartha Kitts'!

723
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,239
Right, is everything ready?

724
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,039
Yeah, well,
I've got the posters up

725
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,599
and I've put gift bags with
pepper spray beside each chair.

726
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,319
Now, I think it was
a masterstroke

727
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,319
to put the spray
in these elegant bottles.

728
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,519
Why not look stylish
while you defend yourself?

729
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,479
Something's bothering me,
though.

730
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,359
Are we missing something

731
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,039
that's very obviously wrong
with this idea?

732
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,079
I really don't think so.
Oh, look, here comes everyone.

733
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,242
Perfect!

734
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,439
Hello and welcome to this
very special presentation

735
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,399
for women by a woman, me,
a woman, who loves women.

736
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,199
By your seats you'll find
a gift bag, and in that gift bag

737
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,759
you'll find
our very exciting new product.

738
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,206
- No, don't do that.

739
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,999
- No, you're not supposed to...

740
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,919
Alice! Yes! I have some things
I have to say to you!

741
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,079
- No, I need to go!
- No, you are going nowhere.

742
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,199
Now, I know in the past
that you have accused me

743
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,119
of being emotionally
colourblind.

744
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,999
- Arggh!
- Shut up and listen.

745
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,685
But now I've changed.
My sight is perfect.

746
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,079
Now I know what was wrong
with the idea.

747
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,599
And with your sweet lips and
of course your lovely bangers,

748
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,799
I know you're the one for me.

749
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,759
- I'm in terrible pain!
- Me too, Alice, me too!

750
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,439
But that ends now. It ends now.

751
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,884
That could not
have gone better!

752
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,319
No, no, Roy,
that didn't go well at all.

753
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,846
Oh, right, because we're
going to lose our jobs.

754
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,039
- Arrgh!

755
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,519
Mr Reynholm!

756
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,319
So that's the thing - I gave
the boy the can of lager,

757
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,799
so technically I'm guilty
of corrupting a minor.

758
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,999
So it's the reason why
I bought the tramp uniform,

759
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,079
and I've had to
make myself scarce.

760
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,359
So you need somewhere
to hide out?

761
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,439
Yeah, somewhere off-piste.

762
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,239
- Where no-one will find you.
- Bottom of the world.

763
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,159
You can use our office
if you like.

764
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,479
Whoa!

765
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,559
Well, I'll need someone to take
care of business upstairs.

766
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,759
We're not doing anything.

767
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,399
Well, this is perfect.

768
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,882
My wonderful assistant, Joan,
and her two friends... Ross.

769
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,279
I'm going to go and piss around
on the internet,

770
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,719
but actually,
I'll need some food.

771
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,927
I've already eaten
one of the toys in here.

772
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,119
Did he just say
what I think he said?

773
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,999
I wasn't really listening.

774
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,919
Is this... Is what's
happening good now?

775
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,639
- Is this good?
- Yes, it's a very good outcome.

776
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,839
Oh, my God! I think we've come
out on top. I can't believe it.

777
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,639
We've come out on top.

778
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,479
Jen Barber.

779
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,879
- Oh, I forgot about you.
- Oh, God, that's impressive.

780
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,248
They're actually watching us.
Hey, mate, am I in Anonymous?

781
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,559
Silence, Small Person Racist.

782
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,159
Greetings, Jen Barber.
This is your sentence.

783
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,439
You've been found guilty
of the most appalling lack

784
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,639
of basic human kindness
and decency.

785
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,159
-- Come in.

786
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,999
Shush, you!

787
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,759
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Shut up!

788
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,919
- You've been in here for hours.
- I'm doing something. Go away!

789
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,919
Peter, your mother and I
are worried about you.

790
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,719
You're in my room! Get out!

791
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,399
It's a beautiful day. You should
get off this computer.

792
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,999
No, I'm not!

793
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,879
Who is this?
Are these your friends?

794
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,079
I'm sorry, Peter can't play
anymore. He's coming outside.

795
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,799
You said I could stay
here for as long as I wanted.

796
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,639
We said that
you had to come out.

797
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,439
You said I could use
the computer

798
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,159
for two hours every day

799
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,679
as long as I ate my dinner
and did my homework.

800
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,239
I have! What are you doing
taking it away from me?

801
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,439
I have earned my right. I know
my rights, Mum and Dad.

802
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,444
No! No!

803
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,119
This internet's not
working. I can't connect.

804
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,119
Just try
turning it off and on again.

805
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,009
Thanks, Ross.

806
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,759
Reynholm Industries
is changing.

807
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,759
New opportunities, new faces,
a new direction.

808
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,047
A better workplace environment.

809
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,844
Exciting new products.

810
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,279
An inclusive hiring policy.

811
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,399
I am sounding happy.

812
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,119
- Can you be a bit more...
- This is me being happy.

813
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,439
- Just be a bit more...
- I'm being up-beat.

814
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,126
No, I just want you to speak...
Ah, forget it, let's just stop.
