2
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,563
Yes, you do.
You've just used a double negative.

3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,721
- Notice anything?
- What?

4
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,889
- Guess.
- Your eyes. Something wrong with your eyes.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,243
What? No. I have a new cup.
What's wrong with my eyes?

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,489
It's not very distinctive, is it?
How's anyone supposed to know it's yours?

7
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,126
There's a picture of me on it.

8
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,811
- No, there isn't.
- Yes, there is.

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,048
- No, there isn't, Moss.
- Yes, there is.

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,561
I am sick of my things going walkabout.

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,607
With this picture, everyone knows that a
certain Mr Moss might be looking for his cup.

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,370
There is nothing on the cup!

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,245
Wrangle with him
and you'll find your hands full, my friend.

14
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,045
Wrangle with who?
There's no one there!

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,208
- Morning.
- Morning.

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,368
Did you have a nice weekend?

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,608
- It was all right, thanks.
- Not you.

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,043
I did too.

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,162
- Nice scarf.
- I'm not wearing a scarf.

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,362
Not you, Moss!

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,642
Notice anything new about Moss?

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,649
Uh... His eyes?

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,243
- What is wrong with my eyes?
- No, he has a new cup.

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,251
- It's the talk of the office.
- Yes, I think I read about it in <i>Heat</i>

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,127
Receptionist, third floor, Gloria
whatshername. Have you seen her baby?

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,368
I didn't even know she was pregnant.

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,050
She was out to <i>here.</i>

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,323
Yeah, I thought she was stealing
office equipment.

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,920
That's how I got that monitor home.

30
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,369
Whoo!

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,450
- Do you want to sit here?
- Thank you.

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,641
- What?
- Ask me where it is.

33
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,728
- Where what is?
- The picture.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,410
Oh!

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,931
- Where's the picture, Moss?
- It's on the base, Roy.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,122
OK. Well, let's see it, then.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,211
Sure - I pour hot squash all over myself
and we all have a good chuckle.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,164
Everyone except muggins here...

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,169
who will show you in a minute.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,046
- Can I ask you two a question?
- Please, Christ, yes!

41
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,128
Wait, wait, one moment. Wait.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,407
OK, go.

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,081
How can you two live like this?

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,808
- "How can you two..."
- Don't Google the question, Moss!

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,651
- What are you talking about?
- It's so disgusting in here.

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,129
I mean, I know nobody comes down here, but it
doesn't mean you have to live like animals.

47
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,483
For starters, you could clean that window
and then you'd have a bit of light in here.

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,841
- What window?
- That one, up there.

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,645
- Yeah, that's not a window.
- Yes, it is.

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,445
Get it clean,
you'll have some light in here.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,722
I think that we have plenty of light...

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,843
I think that it's fine.

53
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,806
I mean, look at that CD tray.
Isn't that important?

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,050
Wouldn't you like to actually
put CDs in there at some point?

55
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,687
Well, yes, ideally.
But I haven't the heart to move them.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,561
I mean, how did that even happen?

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,208
OK. Now I'm curious.
Give us a look at the picture, then?

58
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,721
- What picture?
- The picture on the cup.

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,763
Right.

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,721
Behold!

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,129
There's nothing there!

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,526
What?

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,208
This isn't my cup!

64
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,091
- What is that?
- Goat's cheese salad.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,009
Ugh! Ohhh!

66
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,806
- You don't like goat's cheese?
- I don't like goat's anything.

67
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,563
I don't like goats being involved at any
stage of the food production process.

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,368
Would I blow everyone's mind
if I ate dessert first?

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,884
- What are you eating, anyway?
- It's a bucket of fried chicken.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,367
And it comes in a real bucket now.

71
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,251
Tell me, what's behind that red door?

72
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,285
Nothing.

73
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,291
- Well, there must be something behind it.
- There's nothing behind the red door, Jen.

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,086
- Well, then I can just go and...
- No, Jen. It's just a boring old storeroom!

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,204
It's just a storeroom
where we keep the... snibbits.

76
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,607
What's a snibbit?

77
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,848
It's a kind of plange.

78
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,009
- Oh, a plange for the computers?
- Yes, computer plange.

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,249
Well, if it's a storeroom,
we can store some of this stuff...

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,331
No again, Jen! Look, I know that
you wanna make your mark down here,

81
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,091
and that's really sweet, but, um...

82
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,922
you can't just go messing around
with the snibbit storeroom willy-nilly.

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,409
You can't upset
the whole harmony of the place.

84
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,329
Harmony? What harmony?

85
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,807
I know that the place
looks like a bit of a mess,

86
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,402
but it's actually
a very delicate ecosystem.

87
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,681
Ecosystem.

88
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,888
Everything is connected.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,968
Connected.

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,931
- It's like the rainforest.
- Like the rainforest.

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,202
You change one thing,

92
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,084
even the tiniest bit,

93
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,488
and the whole rainforest dies.

94
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,725
You don't want the rainforest to die,
do you?

95
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,286
No. I really don't want
the rainforest to die.

96
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,210
Well, that's what will happen
if you open the red door.

97
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,610
Hello, IT.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,486
OK. Well, are you sure
that it's plugged in?

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,126
OK. Well, I'll be up in a minute.

100
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,646
- What was that about?
- Just a girl on four.

101
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,683
Oh, a job. Are you gonna go?

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,804
Yeah, in a while. It can wait.

103
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,083
Why can it wait? She probably needs
to get on. She needs a computer.

104
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,044
Yeah, well, I am reading a comic.

105
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,050
I knew it. Every time I used
to phone IT in my last job,

106
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,925
it took a good couple of hours
before someone got to me.

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,170
That is how we do it. You can't go up
straightaway or they'll all expect it.

108
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,090
- You're killing the rainforest!
- Stop saying that.

109
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,522
It's more than that. Me and this girl,
I asked her out once, she said no,

110
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,722
it all got a little bit embarrassing,
and ever since then

111
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,483
whenever I go up she treats me like I'm
some sort of sexually frustrated cretin.

112
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,082
- Get up there now, please.
- You are not the head of this department.

113
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,204
No, I'm relationship manager.
I'm the one who gets the complaints.

114
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,130
I'm the one who gets in trouble.
I'm the one whose name is on the line.

115
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,961
Oh, God! All right, I will go up
just to shut you up.

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,962
For God's sake.

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,325
Someone under here.

118
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,488
Yes!

119
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,369
Hello.

120
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,970
Hello?

121
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,808
Um...

122
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,609
Did you get it fixed?

123
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,290
Oh. Yeah.
Well, I left him to it.

124
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,131
Yeah, I like it when they just go.

125
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,368
Oh!

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,370
- Oh, dear me.
- What are you laughing at?

127
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,802
This flipping circuit board, Jen.

128
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,642
Some chump has run the data lines
right through the power supply.

129
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,842
Amateur hour!

130
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,406
I've got tears in my eyes.

131
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,451
Roy's stuck under a desk.

132
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,006
Stuck under a desk?

133
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,851
Yes. It is an unusual text, isn't it?
It's not just me?

134
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,167
No. It's unusual.

135
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,647
- I'd best investigate.
- Yes. You investigate.

136
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,206
I'll hold the fort.

137
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,689
- Listen, I'm really sorry about your hand.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

138
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,407
- I must've cut it when I swooned.
- I startled you.

139
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,286
I didn't know there was anyone else was down
here. I thought it was just the three of us.

140
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,802
Well, I often work nights,
so perhaps that's why you haven't seen me.

141
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,845
- Gosh, it's very cold in here, isn't it?
- Hm. Air conditioning.

142
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,770
- Keeps these things cool.
- Yes, what are they?

143
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,281
I've no idea.

144
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,607
- <i>They put</i> me in charge of them.
- Moss and Roy.

145
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,848
I don't know their names.

146
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,450
I mean, I don't know
what any of this stuff even does.

147
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,528
What's going on there?

148
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,244
I don't know.

149
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,330
Is it good that it's doing that?

150
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,365
Occasionally it doesn't do that,
and I think I should tell them but...

151
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,448
often I just look away.

152
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,201
And this one. Flash.

153
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,401
Flash.

154
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,687
Flash.

155
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,691
Then wait for it,
nothing for a while, here it comes...

156
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,571
Double flash.

157
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,251
- Brilliant.
- Wow!

158
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,806
It's obvious you're going mad.

159
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,606
So let me get this straight.
You stay down here all the time?

160
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,281
I pop out occasionally
when I have to get supplies.

161
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,447
And you don't know why you're here
or what you do?

162
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,800
Correct.

163
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,764
So this is your job?
This is what you want for a career?

164
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,123
No. You don't understand.

165
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm not here
because I want to be here.

166
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,562
This is...
This is my punishment.

167
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,241
You see, I used to be
Denholm's second-in-command.

168
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,888
Do I amaze you?

169
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,486
So how did you end up down here?

170
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,491
That's a question I've been asking myself
for four long years.

171
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,922
Oh, I couldn't help noticing
that you're bleeding.

172
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,001
- Yes. No, it's fine. It's just a little nick...
- Just let me... Please, I can help. I can...

173
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,282
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

174
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,370
Oh, my God! Please...
Excuse me. What are you do...?

175
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,086
Agh! Oh, get off me! Get off...

176
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,206
- Thank you.
- That should clear up nicely.

177
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,882
Yes, there was a time
when things were very different.

178
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,082
<i>I was one of Reynholm Industries' top guys.
You should've seen me. I was magical.</i>

179
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,161
<i>Here's me saying some pretty important stuff
to a group of people circled around me.</i>

180
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,329
<i>In the boardroom I was a wizard,
a punchy character.</i>

181
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,681
<i>Here's me with a graph.</i>

182
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,291
<i>Things were moving fast so fast</i>

183
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,529
<i>My career was advancing
by leaps and bounds.</i>

184
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,291
<i>Denholm saw great things for me.</i>

185
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,091
<i>They were crazy, heady days.</i>

186
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,931
<i>It seemed like those days
would last forever.</i>

187
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,008
<i>But it all changed</i>

188
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,763
Wow! So, what happened?

189
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,603
- Hm. Well, it's quite a long story, actually.
- Really? Don't worry about it, then.

190
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,889
Oh, my good gracious me!
Look at that!

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,082
Whoa. Quick.

192
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,329
- What is it?
- I can't explain it.

193
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,480
You're just going to have to come over here
and look out this window for a while.

194
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,171
Look, whatever it is,
we're not interested.

195
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,523
Well, I have to say
you're missing out.

196
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,165
Fine.

197
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,531
Jiminy... Jones!

198
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,645
Look. The nature of the thing
that is happening has changed slightly,

199
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,809
rendering it yet more interesting.

200
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,242
Someday I will tell my kids about this.

201
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,125
You can't even tell <i>us.</i>
How are you gonna tell your children?

202
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,848
Well, you have no interest
in the world.

203
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,447
- Are you sure it's OK to come out?
- Yeah. Don't you worry about those two.

204
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,760
Now, listen, Richmond.
I've always wanted to know, yeah?

205
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,610
Why do you never see any cockney Goths?

206
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,961
They're too cheerful.

207
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,048
They spoil it for the rest of us.

208
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,845
And how come you never see
Goths driving cars?

209
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,645
Oh, we drive cars.
We're just like you, really.

210
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,287
Except that we listen to Cradle of Filth.

211
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,641
- Cradle of Filth? I presume that's a band.
- Mm.

212
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,802
- It's not literally a cradle of filth?
- Oh, no. That would be horrible.

213
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,370
Cradle of Filth are actually one of the best
contemporary dark-wave bands in the world.

214
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,246
I'll never forget
the first time I heard them.

215
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,890
It changed my life.

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,924
<i>Blew my mind</i>

217
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,281
<i>It was lucky I discovered them
when I did,</i>

218
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,769
<i>because it was around that time that things
started to go wrong for me at work.</i>

219
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,046
<i>I don't know what happened, but suddenly
people just weren't returning my calls.</i>

220
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,722
<i>In my strategy meetings
people seemed distracted, distant</i>

221
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,889
<i>I couldn't put my finger on it,
but something was wrong.</i>

222
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,046
I'll tell you,

223
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,085
it was good to have the Filth to come
home to after another disappointing day.

224
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,130
You've got to help Roy!

225
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,325
Richmond's out of his room. He's not in his
room. He's supposed to be in his room.

226
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,124
Why is he out of his room?

227
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,529
Well, he's gonna come out
and play with us for a while.

228
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,085
But the rainforest and...

229
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,564
What's wrong with you, Moss?

230
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,526
- Roy's stuck underneath a lady's desk.
- What, still?

231
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,563
Look, I know that normally
this would be very funny,

232
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,648
but he's been there too long
for a reasonable explanation.

233
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,003
- That woman will assume he's a desk rabbit.
- What's a desk rabbit?

234
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,044
I just made that up.

235
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,640
But that's probably going to be
what they start to call people like Roy.

236
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,444
But Roy's not a desk rabbit,
he's my best friend,

237
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,610
and unless you do something it's just gonna
be you, me and Tim Burton over there.

238
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,370
What can I possibly do?

239
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,131
Look, she could look under there any
minute. It could already be too late.

240
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,164
- But I don't know what to do.
- You're relationship manager.

241
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,648
All right, all right!
Just to shut you up.

242
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,845
Hello, Richmond. How are things?

243
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,850
Oh, you know... Not brilliant.

244
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,051
He's supposed to be in his room.

245
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,525
Oooh... There's a builder outside
taking off his shirt.

246
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,927
- Like in ads?
- Yeah, like in ads.

247
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,206
- Everything all right downstairs?
- Fine. I left Moss and Richmond in charge.

248
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,164
Good. Moss should... Richmond?!
He's not out of his room, is he?!

249
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,167
Yeah.

250
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,443
What did I say about the red door?
I said don't open the red door!

251
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,403
What have you got against him?

252
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,569
- I just don't like him.
- God, you're just like the rest of them,

253
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,127
the people that turned their backs on him
as soon as he became a Goth.

254
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,084
He obviously hasn't told you
about the funeral. Hmm.

255
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,204
I think that you should ask him
about the funeral.

256
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,326
- Hello, Denholm.
- Hi, Jen. I'm just enjoying this cup of tea.

257
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,447
Brilliant!

258
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,801
- How are you doing, Jen?
- Yeah.

259
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,127
Just to say, um...

260
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,208
I met Richmond.

261
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,482
I see.

262
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,046
It's not for me to say,
Denholm, but...

263
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,290
it sounds like you two
had a good relationship at one point.

264
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,086
- You should speak to him.
- I'll thank you to keep out of this, Jen.

265
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,044
- Goths are people too.
- Enough!

266
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,920
There's absolutely no point
to anything.

267
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,771
You're right.
No point. It's all futile.

268
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,123
Can't even find my cup.

269
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,723
- You try to look on the bright side.
- Hah! The bright side.

270
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,006
Sometimes you just think, "What would
actually change if I just killed myself?"

271
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,966
You're right.
I <i>could just</i> kill myself.

272
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,007
And it'd be so easy, wouldn't it?
So very, very easy.

273
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,043
- Richmond!
- Huh!

274
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,561
Get back to your room!

275
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,684
What's the point of sending him back?
What's the point of anything?

276
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,770
- Quick! The brush.
- But she said I could come out.

277
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,201
You can't come out.
You're bringing everyone down.

278
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,163
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, he is.

279
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,930
- Come on!
- Thank you.

280
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,487
OK, then tell her why they sent you
down here. Tell her what you did.

281
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,171
I didn't do anything.
I don't know why I'm down here.

282
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,681
So Denholm just demoted you
for nothing, did he?

283
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,761
No, he changed after his father died.
I don't think he ever fully recovered.

284
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,330
From the moment I saw him at the funeral
I could tell there was something different.

285
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,968
Bloody good of you to come.
Thanks.

286
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,811
Thanks.
Bloody good service, wasn't it?

287
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,481
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Watch your bloody hand.

288
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,688
I'm so sorry.

289
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,451
Here. It's Cradle of Filth.

290
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,211
They got me through
some pretty bleak times.

291
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,607
Try track four - "Coffin Fodder".

292
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,520
It sounds horrible
but it's actually quite beautiful.

293
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,168
Relationship manager.

294
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,927
Yes. Yes, of course.

295
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,008
First thing tomorrow.

296
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,888
That was Denholm.

297
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,207
He wants to see you.

298
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,848
What is it?!

299
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,407
- I can't believe you want me back.
- You've got Jen to thank for that.

300
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,205
Her words the other day
moved me deeply.

301
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,209
Very deeply indeed.

302
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,130
- Really? What did she say?
- I can't remember.

303
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,369
The point is, it's the effect
of her words that's important.

304
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,963
I now know that treating someone differently
just because of their skin colour is wrong.

305
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,766
I don't see why things can't get back
to the way they were.

306
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,325
I just don't know what to say.

307
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,442
- You're back with the big guys, Richmond.
- Great.

308
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,690
That's if you're prepared to take <i>me
</i> on again. You know how demanding I am.

309
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,441
Stop it.

310
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,211
- You know how changeable I can be.
- Yes, Mr Reynholm.

311
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,085
- Call me Denholm.
- Oh, right. Thanks, Denholm.

312
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,366
No, no. I don't like that.
Don't do it again.

313
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,402
Right. Sorry.

314
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,249
I've changed my mind about the whole thing.

315
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,684
- What? You mean I have to stay down here?
- Yes! And leave me alone, you goblin!

316
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,770
Oh, well. I suppose it's not quite so bad
now that I don't have to stay in that room.

317
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,123
Yes, yes.
Well, we're happy to have you.

318
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,562
Oh. Oh!
My milky lens has popped out!

319
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,690
Don't step on it.
You've got to help me find it.

320
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,284
Oh. Actually, I think it's just popped
round the back. It does that sometimes.

321
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,122
Come on.
Come on, little fellow. Go on.

322
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,321
Go on.

323
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,283
It's almost there.

324
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,729
- How about that, then?
- Wow! That looks great.

325
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,171
I told you it was a window.

326
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,561
Bloody lens.

327
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,843
Agh! Urgh!
It's a bit bright in here.
