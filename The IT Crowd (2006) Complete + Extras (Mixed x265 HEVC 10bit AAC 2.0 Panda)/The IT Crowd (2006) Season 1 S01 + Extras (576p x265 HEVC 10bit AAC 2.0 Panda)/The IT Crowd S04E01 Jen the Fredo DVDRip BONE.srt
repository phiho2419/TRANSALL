1
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,129
Jen, have a listen to this.

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,605
Moss, have you seen the newsletter?

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,768
Does this sound mysterious?

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,128
Yeah, yeah, it's quite mysterious.

5
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,720
I was hoping for "ruddy mysterious".

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,924
It's fairly mysterious.

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,840
I'm compiling a playlist for
a role-playing game I'm hosting.

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,009
Important to get the right atmos.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,929
Okay, I don't know
what you're talking about.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,849
Kind of like a Dungeons & Dragons thing.

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,849
Oh, is this something to do with sex?

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,123
Ha! Far from it, Jen.
No, you see, in role-playing,

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,608
one person is a dungeon master
or game master or keeper.

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,803
He or she controls the world and tells
the players what they're experiencing,

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,604
whether it be battling
with a coal monster

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,281
or just kicking back in a smelly
old tavern with some roguish elves.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,448
Played over a few hours,
the game employs dice rolls

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,403
to determine the outcome
of certain events.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,727
Now, unlike most board games
you might be familiar with,

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,127
role-playing games often use
a 20-sided dice...

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,207
- Moss?
- Yeah?

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,086
- I want to stop listening to this.
- I completely understand.

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,449
So, in the world we actually live in,

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,167
a post has opened up
for Entertainments Manager.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,245
I could do that. That sounds great!

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,161
Better than whatever this job is.
Entertainments Manager.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,409
It's not for you, Jen.

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,847
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,088
"Organising cultural events
for visiting business partners."

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,690
That is so me!

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,124
It's not, though.
It's really not for you.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,402
Oh, what am I talking to you for?
Where's Roy?

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,487
Not in yet.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,080
Is he still moping about
after that girl?

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,771
Worse than ever.
Thank God he can't play guitar.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,325
Have you seen the pictures?

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,442
Pictures?
There's more than one of these?

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,925
Yup, there's a butt-load.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,771
And she's Photoshopped
out of all of them?

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,043
Yeah. It's like someone
broke up with Stalin.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,489
It's such a shame.

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,485
I've never seen him happier than he's
been the last few months. And now...

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,364
- Oh. Hi, Roy.
- Hi, Roy.

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,930
It's okay. You were obviously
talking about me.

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,202
- No, no, no...
- It's fine.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,368
I realise I haven't been
the easiest person

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,403
to be around the last few weeks,

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,922
but I really feel like I've turned
the corner now, I really do.

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,202
So, if we could all just carry on
as normal...

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,890
My God, oh, my God...

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,010
I feel like I've come out
the other side of it now,

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,566
so everything's going to be okay
from here on...

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,170
My heart hurts!

54
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,966
You do seem better than yesterday.

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,321
But Roy, you've got
to snap out of this.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,001
- I know, I know!
- Some things just don't work out.

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,930
I know you're not used to being
in a long-term relationship.

58
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,008
It's really rare for me!

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,130
It's so rare.

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,001
But take it from me,
most of them just don't work out.

61
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,170
She's right, Roy.

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,010
- And how would you know?
- I do all right.

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,641
When?

64
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,843
Well, if you must know,
I met a girl on holiday.

65
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,810
They're always on holiday,
aren't they, Moss?

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,481
Oh, shut up, Dumpo,
the elephant who got dumped!

67
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,806
- Hey, hey!
- Well...

68
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,447
No, no, it's okay. I'm... I'm all right.

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,881
I mean, I'm still a bit...
You know, she never said goodbye.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,287
So I just kind of...
And you know, it still just hurts

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,244
just a little bit whenever I...
whenever I think about her.

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,250
So I guess all I have to do
is just never think about her!

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,206
"Simples!" Oh, she used to love that ad!

74
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,329
It's not for you, Jen.

75
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,641
What? Why not?

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,650
Entertainments Manager?
Do you know what that involves?

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,161
Well, from what I can gather,
it's just organising cultural events

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,169
for out-of-town business partners.

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,011
That's right. Yes, yes.
It's not for you.

80
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,887
But as far as I can see,

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,128
it won't interfere with my duties
in the IT department.

82
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,847
I love culture.
I've seen We Will Rock You four times!

83
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,521
Oh.

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,561
Well, Jen, I'd love to help you,
but traditionally,

85
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,480
the role of Entertainments Manager
has always been held by a man.

86
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,729
Mr Reynholm, I don't need
to remind you of the report

87
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,171
that denounced Reynholm Industries

88
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,931
as "an institutionally
sexist organisation"?

89
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,611
Now, you hold on a minute, sugar tits!

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,047
Everyone saw through that report.

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,291
And I even got that award
off those feminists.

92
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,131
The one shaped like
the ice cream fellow.

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,320
That's a Shithead of the Year award.

94
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,802
It actually says it on the base.
"Shithead of the Year."

95
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,366
Did you not read the base?

96
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,760
Oh!

97
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,849
- Oh, God.
- Women, eh?

98
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,608
What are they? Who knows?

99
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,165
Don't do this.

100
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,803
Can't live with them,
can't find them, sometimes.

101
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,648
What's going on in their little heads?
Don't ask me!

102
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,850
I'm not a flippin' women's psychiatrist.

103
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,889
But I have learned one or two things
from conversations with my mother.

104
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,646
No. No, Moss, please.

105
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,603
Don't go any further.
Just stop right there!

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,200
You're no good
at this kind of thing, Moss.

107
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,765
You'll just make it worse!

108
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,723
Sorry, it's just...
I've never seen you like this.

109
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,162
No, I know, but I'll be fine.
I will... It's just...

110
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,722
You can't help with this.
You just can't.

111
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,810
- I got it! I got the job!
- What?

112
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,003
Douglas gave me the job
so I'd stop talking!

113
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,002
Jen's Entertainments Manager.

114
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,569
It's not for you, Jen.

115
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,765
Why does everyone keep saying that?

116
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,087
- What happened to Jerry?
- Massive heart attack.

117
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,281
I'm not surprised!

118
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,721
Why are you not surprised?
Why is it not for me?

119
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,081
Jerry was, uh...
He was the company Fredo.

120
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,531
You're the new Fredo!

121
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,051
I don't know what you're talking about.

122
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,764
Fredo. From The Godfather

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,291
Who's Fredo again? Who's he in it?

124
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,561
You know, he's the brother,

125
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,206
whose job it is to take
out-of-town businessmen and...

126
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,403
Show them a good time, yeah!
That's what I have to do.

127
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,806
I was thinking West End show...

128
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,604
No, no. No, no, no, Jen.
I don't think you understand.

129
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,123
These men are going to expect a lot more
than a West End show.

130
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,642
Fredo, Jen, he was...

131
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,166
- He was sort of a pimp.
- Oh, shut up.

132
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,009
- Wasn't he, Moss?
- What?

133
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,930
Fredo, in the film, he was...
He was essentially a pimp.

134
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,281
No! He took the ring to Mordor.

135
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,364
Fredo was a pimp.

136
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,131
No. No, that film was the '70s.

137
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,767
Things are different now.
Businessmen are different.

138
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,365
Anyway. Enough about our balls!

139
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,328
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Jen.

140
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,521
Ah...

141
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,770
- Marvellous.
- Lovely.

142
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,727
No, no, no, no.
Jen's our new Entertainments Manager.

143
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,522
But she's a woman, isn't she?

144
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,289
Jen, I'd like you to meet
an old friend of mine, Phil,

145
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,289
and two men named John.

146
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,166
What are you up to, Reynholm?

147
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,520
Don't you worry, Phil.

148
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,803
Jen may look like an old maid
holding pennies in her arse,

149
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,721
but she knows the sleaziest routes round
this old town I like to call Londinius.

150
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,003
And I'm sure she's planned something
suitably raucous for you reprobates.

151
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,687
Well, yes, yes. I have tickets
for a wonderful show in the West End.

152
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,167
- As long as it doesn't have subtitles.
- Subtitles? No.

153
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,124
- Whoa! What's got subtitles?
- This thing she's bringing us to.

154
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,685
Subtitles? Oh, God!

155
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,167
I can't read while I'm also
trying to see things!

156
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,410
No, no, it's a show, it's a show.
There's no subtitles.

157
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,205
I hate subtitles.
What happened to Jerry?

158
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,446
His heart exploded.

159
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,211
Brilliant!

160
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,890
No, he's quite seriously ill.

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,809
That's classic Jerry!

162
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,730
Ah, yes.

163
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,446
Jerry wouldn't have brought us
to something with subtitles.

164
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,528
There's no subtitles, it's a show!

165
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,530
Come on, Jen, what type of show?

166
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,087
Well, uh...
Yes, well, it's very raunchy, yes.

167
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,202
I... I don't think
you'll be disappointed.

168
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,287
Women in it?

169
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,927
Yes, it's an all-woman show.
It's very rude.

170
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,520
- An all-woman show.
- And it's rude!

171
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,051
Eiffel Tower!

172
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,646
Oh, I'm so, so sorry,
I really can't apologise enough.

173
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,286
I've never been
so embarrassed in my life!

174
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,008
That woman was in EastEnders!
How dare you humiliate her?

175
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,483
It's not our fault you took us to
something called The Vagina Monologues,

176
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,524
you get there,
and it's just women talking.

177
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,165
That's false advertising!

178
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,169
Look, we're in town for five more days,

179
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,681
you'd better have something proper
for us to do.

180
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,883
And the next time you take us
to something about talking fannies,

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,480
it had better be about talking fannies!

182
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,646
I know you had good reasons
for giving me this award.

183
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,765
I should never have done that interview.
But that journalist had an agenda!

184
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,611
There's more.
"Women are a kind of savage animal,

185
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,361
"whom men have civilised
with their insatiable sexuality."

186
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,721
What don't you like about that?

187
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,683
"Women are essentially no different
from radiators."

188
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,608
"I like my women
like I like my toast. Hot..."

189
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,882
"And consumable with butter."

190
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,011
You don't have to remind me.

191
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,090
I'm all too familiar
with my misguided words.

192
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,682
Ladies, listen, no one could
mistake me for Gok Wan.

193
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,840
I have an old-fashioned mindset
but, damn it, at least I try!

194
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,607
And Reynholm Industries is changing,
ladies, for the better.

195
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,405
The glass ceiling is now a glass floor.

196
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,929
The women are floating above it
and the men are just looking up at them.

197
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,528
So what do you want from us?

198
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,401
What?

199
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,082
Oh! Please take that award back
and give it to somebody else.

200
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,806
Mr Reynholm, I really need
to talk to you about something.

201
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,367
Ah, Jen. I'd like you to meet
some very special women.

202
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,444
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- What?

203
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,530
Mr Reynholm, I will not
work with prostitutes.

204
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,046
No, no, no. These are feminists.

205
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,721
You can dress it up however you like,
they still sleep with men for money.

206
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,649
I'm sorry, no of fence.

207
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,081
But I don't charge for these potatoes
and I don't like women who do.

208
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,525
Don't listen to her. The bitch is crazy.

209
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,084
Douglas wants me to see out the week.

210
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,091
A whole week in the company
of those idiots!

211
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,605
Culture's out, restaurants are out.
Oh, God, this is a nightmare!

212
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,531
Oh!

213
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,806
Men, eh?

214
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,370
What are they like? With their
bawdy talk and roughhousing,

215
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,407
and their wandering hands
and breath in the morning? Oh.

216
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,091
I'd like to see them have the babies!

217
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,126
What are you getting at, Moss?

218
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,050
Well, unless I'm very much mistaken,
this seems to be a problem

219
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,925
for which you need the male perspective.

220
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,409
Do you know any men?

221
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,526
You want a good time, right?

222
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,610
One that walks on the wild side
without compromising your principles?

223
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,529
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

224
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,449
Then you got it, baby!

225
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,926
Which is why the game needs
a 20-sided dice.

226
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,406
I've not understood a word
you've just said.

227
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,000
What is it, some sort of computer game?

228
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,920
In a sense, except it uses the most
powerful processor known to man,

229
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,530
the human mind.

230
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,845
But you're not playing.

231
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,281
I'm not a player. But I am playing.

232
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,607
He sort of tells us what's happening.

233
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,484
I will be your guide.

234
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,968
Through my words, you will experience
the land of Elfenheart.

235
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,402
From the mighty mountains
that border the Goblin Wastelands

236
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,730
to the sewers that run like
a spider web through the city of Jandor.

237
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,127
I, gentlemen, will be your eyes.

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,207
I will be everyone you meet,

239
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,847
every creature you encounter,
every trap you spring.

240
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,360
What about him?

241
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,927
What's this business
with the face like a slapped arse?

242
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm sorry, I just...

243
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,482
I just came out of a long-term
relationship so... It doesn't...

244
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,410
She was the greatest woman I've ever met
and I'm never going to see her again.

245
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,285
But it's fine, I mean,
she never said goodbye, so...

246
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,970
I'm not going to bore you with it.

247
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,969
See that you bloody don't!

248
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,401
I still don't understand
what this game is!

249
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,931
It seems gay.

250
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,203
Are dragons gay, Phil?

251
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,489
Mighty warrior priests
wielding golden staffs?

252
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,011
I suppose they're gay, too!

253
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,246
Uh...

254
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,720
Here are your character sheets.
John 1 , you're a unicorn man.

255
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,448
John 2, you're a wood fairy.

256
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,607
And Phil, you're the
gypsy assassin, Esmerelda.

257
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,127
I'm a woman?

258
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,010
I don't think I want to be a woman.

259
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,521
Just go with it. It will end.

260
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,048
So, gentlemen, are you prepared
to open the doors to your minds

261
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,970
and travel to worlds
hitherto undreamed of?

262
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,448
Hey, hey, hey!

263
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,363
Look at those funbags!

264
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,842
Everybody doing okay, yeah, yeah?
You good for drinks?

265
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,806
Loosen up! It's a role-playing party!

266
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,446
Jen, can I have a word?

267
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,281
I don't think I want to hang
with these guys.

268
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,042
Oh, come on, Phil.
These guys are the best.

269
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,083
They're gonna do things tonight
that'll blow your mind.

270
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,326
Really?

271
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,283
Look at them.
They're young, they're keen

272
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,971
and all they want to do
is show you a good time.

273
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,209
So get back there
before you hurt their feelings.

274
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,808
Could I...could I steal
the lovely Roy for a sec?

275
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,761
It's just him in all of these.

276
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,323
Oh, thanks, Jen, that was all
getting a little bit...

277
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,364
- What do you think you're doing?
- What?

278
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,369
Bringing everyone down
with your private life?

279
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,164
They don't want to know about
your miserable private life!

280
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,363
They're here for a good time.
Look at that face.

281
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,531
Who'd want to role-play with that face?

282
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,442
I'm sorry, Jen. I'm just...
I'm not feeling it tonight.

283
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,043
Then fake it, sweetheart, yeah?

284
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,001
You're getting good money for this.

285
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,368
Don't you want to get the deposit for
a flat? Leave those bad memories behind.

286
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,045
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

287
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,371
I'll try harder, Jen.

288
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,086
Okay. Good girl.

289
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,843
Get back there and show
those Johns a good time.

290
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,567
Well, that cleaned the pipes.

291
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,451
I've got to thank you, Miranda,
for giving me a second chance.

292
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,721
Oh, don't mention it.

293
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,686
Although you do know I don't have the
authority to take back the award myself?

294
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,086
Oh, what?

295
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,520
No, we all make mistakes.
And you intrigue me.

296
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,282
Something tells me there's
more to you than meets the eye.

297
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,404
Do you mean the rumours
that I killed my wife?

298
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,045
- No. Are there rumours?
- No.

299
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,442
There were rumours
that there was a rumour,

300
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,642
but that was just bullshit.

301
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,162
I didn't like the way the nominations
came from inside your company.

302
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,441
Inside my company?

303
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,289
Yeah, one of the women
from the IT department

304
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,290
faxed a dossier of your behaviour
over the last 12 months.

305
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,006
One of the women in the IT department?

306
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,528
- Oh.
- Sorry, Phil.

307
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,211
"Heal all" is probably the worst spell
you could have used.

308
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,606
The sound of your low-level magic

309
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,245
attracts the attention
of the palace guards.

310
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,771
- Damn it!
- Oh!

311
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,288
One comes through the door.

312
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,721
- Throwing knife.
- Are you sure? Quite a low damage.

313
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,241
I have a plus 40% chance of a critical.

314
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,523
Remember the talking bunny
that gave me that magic bracelet?

315
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,450
Yeah, that bunny thing
gave him that thing.

316
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,201
You're absolutely right. Roll 'em.

317
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,285
Yes!

318
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,167
Direct hit.

319
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,123
The knife cleaves his head in twain

320
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,084
and some of his brains runneth
down John 2's invisibility cloak.

321
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,486
Eiffel Tower!

322
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,647
Oh!

323
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,201
- Unfortunately, he wasn't alone.
- Damn it!

324
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,606
- Oh!
- Ooh!

325
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,404
'Tis the dreaded Imperial Guard,

326
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,364
the cruellest of all
of Queen Elisa's troops.

327
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,051
At their head, someone you recognise.

328
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,882
"Well, well, well,
if it isn't the adventurers

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,685
"what have been causing me
all this bother."

330
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,041
- Lucius Santana!
-"The very same!"

331
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,609
Stand your men down, Lucius!
We have no quarrel with you!

332
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,290
"Quarrel? I just came to see

333
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,482
"how a mismatched bunch of
raggle-taggle adventurers

334
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,523
"bested some of the deadliest criminals
in Crackenwood."

335
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,369
- Oh!
- That's us!

336
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,486
"You have my thanks.

337
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,366
"And if ever you want to join
the Palace Guard, you know where I am."

338
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,130
The Palace Guard!

339
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,450
You have my sword.

340
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,891
And my staff.

341
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,809
And my bunny bracelet.

342
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,047
And whatever it is that I have.

343
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,570
The mist clears.
You see a lone female figure.

344
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,443
That's ruddy mysterious.

345
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,084
"Hello, Darkharden."

346
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,248
Hello. Who goes there?

347
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,603
"'Tis I, Queen Elisa Eldridge
of the Elves,

348
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,690
"who cruelly jilted you
not three moons ago."

349
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,690
Don't do this.

350
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,964
Just go with it, Roy.

351
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,330
Hello, my queen.

352
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,171
How are you?

353
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,320
"I'm fine. You look well."

354
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,322
So do you. Does she?

355
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,886
- Yes, she does, actually.
- Does she?

356
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,041
"So, what are you up to?"

357
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,283
Oh, you know, just... Just keeping busy.

358
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,688
Missing you a little bit.

359
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,246
Yourself?

360
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,608
"Usual boring pageantry.

361
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,641
"You know how the people
of Pippsiehollow love a parade."

362
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,123
What are you doing here?

363
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,527
- Sorry.

364
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,846
Sorry.

365
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,201
-- Sorry. Bear with me, bear with me.

366
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,321
Bear with me.

367
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,248
"I sense a sadness in you."

368
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,324
It's just hard. You know?

369
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,011
I miss you.

370
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,120
I can still smell you on our pillow.

371
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,211
When I close my eyes,
it's still your face I see.

372
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,050
It's just hard.

373
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,726
You were here and then you were gone.

374
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,964
What do you want?

375
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,289
"It was not easy for me
to come here, Darkharden.

376
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,801
"But I had one thing I felt
I needed to say to you.

377
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,211
- "Goodbye."

378
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,920
Goodbye.

379
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,168
Brilliant night! Brilliant!

380
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,682
I can't believe I've never
tried role-playing games before.

381
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,521
I'm going to go home and tell
the whole rugby club about it.

382
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,969
Roy and Moss did not disappoint.

383
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,811
They did not!
I'd like to see them again.

384
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,610
Thank you, Douglas.

385
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,803
That's one special little lady
you've got there.

386
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,844
I'm glad Jerry died.

387
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,731
- Eiffel Tower!
- Eiffel Tower!

388
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,325
Eiffel Tower!

389
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,648
- Eiffel Tower!
- Eiffel Tower!

390
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,684
Before you go, Jen, I know it was you.

391
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,723
You broke my heart. You broke my heart.

392
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,164
- That's right. That's right.
- Shut up!

393
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,566
Oh, you've cheered up.

394
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,684
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling
a lot better, Jen, thanks.

395
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,326
Thanks to a certain Elfin queen.

396
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,528
What happened to Fredo, in the film?

397
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,450
Ah, um... Oh.
The Godfather has him killed.

398
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,607
I'm going to go home.
I'm not feeling too good.

399
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,490
Problem solved!
