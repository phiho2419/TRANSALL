1
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,165
Oh.

2
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,930
Thank you.

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,406
There we go.

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,488
Do it properly.

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,571
Cheers.

6
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,885
Bill.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,289
Mick Hucknall.

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,846
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, man.

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,645
Hey, this is fun.
It's been a good night so far.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,410
Yeah, it's been really good, yeah.

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,922
Yeah, I'll be honest, when Julie suggested
we get together I was like, "No."

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,568
You know, I get set up a lot by friends,
and it never works out.

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,763
- Tell me about it. Me too.
- I hate dates, usually.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,761
They should call dates
"spend some time with a big fat loser".

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,326
- But this has been brilliant.
- Hey, um...

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,764
I was thinking, afterwards,
maybe you'd like to come back to my place?

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,043
- We could listen to the Jamie Cullum album.
- Maybe, yeah.

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,128
Yeah, that'd be really nice, actually.

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,366
Great.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,924
Let me guess. Um...

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,771
You're a red wine person.

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,611
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Oh! I would be too,

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,089
if we could get some service round here!
Yeah, you, Hucknall.

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,328
When you're Simply Ready.

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,122
Unbelievable.

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,323
Oh, I should say,
I don't really like sharing.

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,967
So you get what you want, I'll get
what I want, we'll leave it at that.

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,287
I just think it's a lot less confusing.

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,607
- Sure, sure. Did you say Jamie Cullum?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,166
Yeah, I hate Jamie Cullum.

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,165
"Oh, and just to say,
I don't really like sharing."

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,208
With the rising inflection and everything. In
a tapas restaurant, he doesn't like sharing.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,605
- What the heck is tapas?
- You know tapas. Tiny food from Spain.

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,406
- Oh, yes. Tay-pas.
- Yeah, that's not how you say it.

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,170
Yes, it is.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,806
You're a tape-ass.

37
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,001
What else? What else?

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,044
What else? Oh, God,
you should have seen him with the waiters.

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,924
- Rude?
- Unbelievable!

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,929
Oh, yeah.
I used to work as a waiter.

41
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,443
If anyone was ever rude to me, I used
to carry their food around in my trousers.

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,928
Oh, my God.
Before you brought it to their table?

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,929
No, after.

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,089
Of course, before.
Why would I do it after?

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,168
Well, do you think they did that to him?

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,046
OK. Well, while he was eating,
did you hear anyone laughing?

47
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,401
Like, in the kitchen area?

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,444
Yes! Yes, I did, actually.
Yes, I did.

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,722
- That'll be trouser food.
- Oh, God!

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,686
- Probably a good thing you weren't sharing.
- Ugh! My God!

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,088
I could have saved you the trouble.
That guy's famous. He's a mouth.

52
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,921
They call him "The News", cos he's
always talking about who he slept with.

53
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,444
Well, I would honestly
rather sleep with a rat. Literally.

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,927
You know,
the thing I cannot understand, yeah?

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,523
This is a man Julie on fifth thinks is perfect
for me. I mean, what was she thinking?

56
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,291
- Wait a second. Who do you know on fifth?
- Why?

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,801
- What was the name? Was it Judy or Julie?
- Why do you need to know?

58
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,967
No reason.

59
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,801
Lots of nice-looking girls on fifth.
Looking for an in, are we?

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,763
An in? No, thank you. No.

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,566
Don't use my name
to start leching around on fifth.

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,001
For your information, I do not lech.

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,885
I have a little more class than that,
thank you very much.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,128
- Post.
- Thank you.

65
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,801
Oh, no, this is wrong. A lingerie catalogue
for a Cathy Morgan for man.

66
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,968
Um, I'll make sure that Cathy gets it.

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,560
I don't know any Cathy Morganforman.
Who's Cathy Morganforman?

68
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,811
Uh, Cathy works in, uh... Cathy works in
the department of, uh, shaloopest.

69
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,969
- Department of what?
- Excuse me. That's my phone ringing.

70
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,287
- I didn't hear anything.
- It's on vibrate.

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,482
Hello? Hello, Cathy.

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,763
Yes, your parcel did arrive.
I'm keeping it here safe for you.

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,770
No problem at all, Cathy Morganforman.

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,282
- If he comes by...
- Right, if who comes by?

75
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,288
- The News.
- Yes, right.

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,131
If he calls, just tell him something.

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,004
- Leave it with me.
- Great.

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,487
Although I should say,
I'm not very good at lying.

79
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,570
- I'm very good at lying.
- I thought you were on the phone.

80
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,125
Yeah, I am.

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,005
Yes, I'm fine...

82
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,766
Hello?

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,011
Listen, Moss, you're not going to
court, yeah? Just tell him something.

84
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,920
Yeah, it's just I've never been very good
at judging the scale of the lie.

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,769
- Stop overthinking.
- I'm not good at it.

86
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,282
- You're getting in a tizz.
- When I was a child, I told a whopper...

87
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,051
Just tell him I'm busy!

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,128
You're busy.

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,765
That's brilliant.

90
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,011
Just don't let him in here
under any circumstances.

91
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,248
No. You're busy.

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,810
What was the name of that girl
that Jen knows? Was it Julie or Judy?

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,809
Yes. One of those.

94
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,571
OK. I'm just going to
go for a lech on fifth.

95
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,966
Yeah.

96
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,321
Look, I told you, she's busy.

97
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,762
Hey, back off, buster.
This lady's busy.

98
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,769
Too busy for you.

99
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,360
Busy. Brilliant.

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,529
- Hello?
- Hello.

101
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,961
I'm just looking for Jen.

102
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,447
I'm afraid Jen can't see you at the moment,
she's very busy.

103
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,927
- Is she?
- She's a busy Miss Lizzie.

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,041
Goodbye.

105
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,130
- What's she doing?
- She's doing fine.

106
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,808
Not "how's she doing?",
what's she doing?

107
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,968
Uh...

108
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,320
- Is she in here?
- No.

109
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,161
- I'll just give her these.
- Don't give her them. She won't like them.

110
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,204
- She won't mind. It's not a problem.
- She will. It is.

111
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,086
- Look, why can't I go in?
- Because she's dead.

112
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,683
- What?
- Yeah, she's dead.

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,768
She... She... She died.

114
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,769
She died last night.

115
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,291
She died?

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,767
Yeah. Completely.

117
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,720
Oh, God!

118
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,411
I... I just can't believe it.

119
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,206
Well, I'd hardly make up
something like that, would I?

120
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,721
No. No, of course not.

121
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,286
Oh, God.

122
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,291
Well, she was a bit off
at the restaurant.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,243
I mean, was it the food?
The tapas? Do they know?

124
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,442
Tay-pas. I don't know.

125
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,767
Yes, it was. Why not? Yeah.

126
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,562
Oh, Jesus.

127
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,969
Oh, I know it's terrible,
but thank God we weren't sharing.

128
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,005
- I just can't get over it.
- Yeah, well, we all have to go sometime.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,002
It's terrible,
it's just terrible.

130
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,122
It's bloody awful.

131
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,482
I mean, she was so beautiful.

132
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,887
She was some piece of ass.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,641
Anywho, can't mourn
all the ruddy day, so...

134
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,965
You know...

135
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,962
I was the last person to sleep with her.

136
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,923
Really? She said that...

137
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,804
What?

138
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,481
She said she was looking forward
to sleeping with you.

139
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,682
I can't believe he lied like that.

140
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,328
Doesn't he realise that lying
can lead to very serious ramifications?

141
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,881
Hello?

142
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,365
Hello.

143
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,210
I'm Roy.

144
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,810
IT.

145
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,481
My boss has assigned me to take on
any work that you might want done,

146
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,204
personay-ly.

147
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,243
Personal... personally.

148
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,169
Basically, if you want to...

149
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,047
just take my card.

150
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,048
And, um...

151
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,323
if you need anything
done, to your computer,

152
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,284
just give me a buzz, on the phone.

153
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,328
It's my mobile phone, so you won't have to
go through all that call-waiting palaver.

154
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,683
- OK. Thank you, Roy.
- You're welcome, Judy.

155
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,448
Oh, I'm not Judy, I'm Julie.

156
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,085
Judy?

157
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,962
Someone to see you.

158
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,289
This man says you're to take his card.

159
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,282
- The girl from IT? That's terrible.
- I know. Terrible. Terrible thing.

160
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,008
You know, I was
actually the last person to sleep with her.

161
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,250
- Very sudden, yes.
- I hear it was some bad tapas.

162
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,408
Tay-pas. Yes.

163
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,841
- You must be stunned.
- I'm flabbergasted.

164
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,928
Well, you know where we are
if you need us.

165
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,361
Sure. I... I'll be fine, thanks.

166
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,362
Just sort of stay away from this whole area
while we come to terms with the loss.

167
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,370
Leave me now. I would be alone.

168
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,204
Oh, God!

169
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,050
Oh, my... Oh!

170
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,124
Good lech?

171
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,561
No!

172
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,524
The girl... Oh, my God.
The girl, Judy?

173
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,769
She's, um...
Have you seen this girl?

174
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,406
- What's she like?
- Well, she has hair on her eyes.

175
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,887
- Who has hair on their eyes?
- Not you.

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,081
No.

177
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,328
I'm going for coffee.
Anyone want anything?

178
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,169
- Yeah, I'd like a...
- No? OK. Bye.

179
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,046
- Hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

180
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,529
Um... Hello, Judy.
What can I do for you?

181
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,247
- Computer's broken.
- Is it a PC or a Mac?

182
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,646
<i>Yes.</i>

183
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,730
- Well, what's wrong with it?
- Broken down.

184
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,047
Yeah, broken down how, Judy?

185
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,561
- Bing-bong noise.
- Bing-bong noise.

186
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,887
What's the precise nature of the problem?

187
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,327
Email.

188
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,364
Judy, the battery on my phone is...

189
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,130
- Look at this.
- What?

190
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,971
How nice is this?

191
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,005
I just got a big load of flowers
and a big card,

192
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,806
and everyone has signed it.

193
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,491
"You will always be in our hearts."

194
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,683
My God, and you said
they weren't nice here?

195
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,961
Yeah.

196
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,970
I don't understand why they've done this.

197
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,481
Why? I'll tell you for why.

198
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,082
It's because everyone
thinks you're brilliant.

199
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,565
- Really?
- Yeah.

200
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,402
And in fact, everyone thinks you're so brilliant,
they've just made you employee of the month.

201
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,726
- No!
- Yes.

202
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,847
- No!
- Yes!

203
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,371
- No!
- Yuh-huh.

204
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,131
- I don't believe it.
- Please believe it.

205
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,322
Oh, my God! Oh!

206
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,331
I didn't even know they had
employee of the month here.

207
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,047
- No, they brought it in just for you.
- Wow!

208
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,242
I'm gonna go up
and thank everybody right now.

209
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,967
- No, don't do that.
- What? Why not?

210
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,048
They'll be embarrassed.

211
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,686
It's embarrassing being thanked.

212
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,528
Don't be silly.

213
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,124
Events seem to be taking
a downward turn.

214
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,683
I told you, stop calling me at work!

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,641
- Oh, it's the beautiful Jen.
- Hello, Small Paul.

216
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,491
Didn't I hear you...?
I thought you were sick, or something.

217
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,570
Sick? Me? No.
I couldn't be better.

218
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,648
I've just won employee of the month.

219
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,570
So, uh... You going my way?

220
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,768
Don't you dare go too fast.
No. No!

221
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,362
Not that fast!

222
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,803
Just hard to get your head round, you know?

223
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,881
One minute she's there, and next minute...
she's gone.

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,005
You know, um... I was the last person
that slept with her, actually.

225
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,881
She held on so tightly, you know.
It was like... It was scary.

226
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,607
But sexy scary, you know?
It was just like...

227
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,964
Jen?

228
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,287
Was that...?

229
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,010
What are you still doing here, Bill?
For God's sake, go home.

230
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,566
- He was the last person to sleep with her.
- I know.

231
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,729
Apparently she was pretty hot stuff.

232
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,527
- Bye, Small Paul.
- Bye, Jen. See you.

233
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,130
Ooh.

234
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,720
Oh, dear. Oh, lord.

235
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,285
Oh!

236
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,091
At this dreadful hour, we're all reminded
how brief our time is here on Earth.

237
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,522
- Sorry, who was it who died?
- I don't know.

238
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,564
I believe Mr Reynholm has a few words.

239
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,760
There's one more angel in heaven.

240
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,484
Ahh!

241
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,682
God, I miss Jen.

242
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,168
She reminded me of me at her age.

243
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,560
I mean, when I was her age,
she reminded me of her age.

244
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,366
She reminded me of my age at her age.

245
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,041
When I was her age,
she was reminded of me...?

246
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,971
I grew to like Jen.

247
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,607
And that enlikening of her
became a friendship.

248
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,601
A friendship which ended so suddenly,
just 12 hours ago.

249
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,770
After what I gather was a rather
sensational evening with Bill Crouse.

250
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,123
Bill, you dog! Mm!

251
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,164
Where is he?
Still cleaning himself off.

252
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,168
She was special.

253
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,490
So special, in fact, that when I called
my close personal friend, Elton John,

254
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,250
and told him about her,

255
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,445
he dropped everything and offered
to come here and perform for us.

256
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,324
You heard me.
He's in the building.

257
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,571
Elton John is going to sing
a beautiful song about death.

258
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,162
Oh, my God.
This is so... so lovely.

259
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,009
Thank you so, so much.
Thank you.

260
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,646
Thank you. Oh, God!

261
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,526
Could I say a few words?

262
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,291
Oh, my God!

263
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,127
Thank you so, so much.

264
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,485
I would... I would not be standing up here
today if it wasn't for so many people.

265
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,525
Not least my dad. Without him...

266
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,722
- Hey, she isn't dead!
- Yeah.

267
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,002
Boo! Hiss!

268
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,521
You lying cow!

269
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,801
Boo!

270
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,684
We want Elton.

271
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,165
We want Elton!

272
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,765
We want Elton!

273
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,411
We want Elton!

274
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,645
OK. If that Judy woman comes down,
I don't work here, you've never seen me,

275
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,364
just make up something,
just get rid of her.

276
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
She's easy to spot.
She has three rows of teeth.

277
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,562
Listen, if I needed to get out
of the country very, very cheaply,

278
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,650
how would I go about doing that?

279
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,091
Hiya.

280
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,607
What did you say about me?

281
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,448
Hello there, Jen.
I would love to stay and chat,

282
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,202
but I've just received a telephone call saying
that my father has just killed someone,

283
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,369
which I need to attend to.

284
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,571
Did you tell everyone I was dead?

285
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,731
Maybe.

286
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,162
Because they all thought I was dead.

287
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,850
Uh...

288
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,491
- Don't kill me! I know something!
- What? What do you know?

289
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,683
- Bill Crouse. He's saying you slept with him.
- He's saying what?

290
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,480
He thinks you're dead, so he's telling
everybody you slept with him.

291
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,445
He's the one you should be angry
at, not me. I'm insignificant.

292
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,608
Bastard!

293
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,887
Voicemail.

294
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,930
Hey. It's Jen.

295
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,204
Stop telling everyone I slept with you,
you bastard!

296
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,327
Must have gone home.

297
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,602
Oh, God, my throat hurts.

298
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,810
Well. It's probably all that shouting.

299
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,009
I'm talking, aren't I?

300
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,443
Can you get me his address?

301
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,805
Um, yes. It might be a bit difficult, I have
to hack into his private company account.

302
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,002
It might take some time.

303
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,441
There we go.

304
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,287
Oh...

305
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,687
Oh, I really don't feel very well.

306
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,531
Well, you look terrible.

307
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,080
I'm still talking, aren't I?

308
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,767
<i>You have one new message.</i>

309
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,326
<i>Hey. It's Jen.</i>

310
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,968
<i>Stop telling people I slept with you,
you bastard!</i>

311
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,489
Where Roy?

312
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,805
Roy's dead.

313
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,562
No. No! Don't break down.
Don't break down! You bitch!

314
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,967
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

315
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,688
Bloody hell.

316
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,680
I don't even know what any of this does.
Oh, my God, it's bloody hopeless!

317
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,962
I don't know what it means!

318
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,641
Come on, come on.
Ritchley Street, Ritchley Street.

319
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,086
Thank God. OK. Um...

320
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,611
Right.

321
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,369
It was, uh, probably the guys.
Probably the guys.

322
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,644
Leaving a message, funny message.
Probably Bob.

323
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,684
It's Bob, leaving funny messages.
And, uh...

324
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,768
And a floating head.

325
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,402
It's just stress.
I'm a bit stressed, is all.

326
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,081
And just fun and games, and...

327
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,847
Oh, God!

328
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,731
- Let me in. Let me in, Bill!
- No!

329
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,640
It's raining. Please, let me in.

330
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,924
- You're never coming in.
- Stop telling people I slept with you.

331
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,407
I will! I will! I'm sorry.

332
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,364
You bastard!

333
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,562
You bastard!

334
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,523
Oh, God, I'm sorry!

335
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,211
You bastard!
