00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,768
Previously on "The IT Crowd"

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,441
Douglas receives a love potion
from a mysterious blind man in the desert

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,884
Enraptured with the lovely Jen Barber,
an employee of Reynholm Industries,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,129
he administers the potion
in the hope of enslaving her heart

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,040
When Douglas drinks the concoction
by mistake, which turns out to be Rohypnol,

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,961
he becomes incredibly aroused, even though
Rohypnol would really only make you tired

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,969
Jen locks him in with Moss and Roy,

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,560
with whom he attempts
to achieve sexual congress.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,160
An enraged Jen embarks on
a lengthy legal process,

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,443
Using brilliant lawyer Jon Rergen,
a friend ofher auntie's.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,043
After months of legal wrangling,
an amicable agreement is finally reached

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,405
You're robbing me blind, Jen.

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,683
Sign here, here, here...

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,283
Yeah, I reckon I know where to sign on
a sexual harassment settlement, thank you!

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,202
I've got to thank you, Jen,
for not taking this matter any further.

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,130
Not only does that show great maturity,
but also...

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,686
- Is she asleep?
- I'm not asleep!

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,643
- All right.
- It's not just the money.

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,728
- I know.
- There's a principle involved.

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,968
Parting with the money was painful enough,

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,766
but the electric pants I have to wear at work
so I don't become aroused,

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,803
they're also painful.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,810
Excuse me...
I'm just charging them.

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,963
Don't say anything that will get me going,
either of you.

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,242
Does it hurt - you know, when you...?

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,362
It's like being Tased in the balls.

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,289
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,121
Like being Tased in the balls...

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,844
except painful.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,803
So, Jen, what are you gonna do
with your 500 quid?

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,969
I don't know.
I still feel we could have got more.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,210
- Now, Jen, we've been through this.
- He tried to use Rohypnol on me.

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,721
I thought it was a magic potion.

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,891
If this went to court,
it'd be your word against mine.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,642
Who are they going to believe?
A woman or an Englishman?

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,889
Oh, up yours!

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,242
That wasn't even sexy.

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,091
These pants are broken.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,204
Urgh! Urgh!

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,930
Sorry to bother you, mate, but I've just
found out my mum's been taken into hospital.

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,601
- My sister'd go, but she moved to Australia.
- Australia?

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,485
I really need to get down there,
but my car's broken down.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,443
- Look, here's 50p.
- That's great.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,246
It's all I've got.
And it's 50p more than that story deserves.

45
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,328
Right.

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,367
I can't believe you got more than me.

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,482
Why wouldn't we?
We were violated, too.

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,809
Violated?!
He chased you around the table.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,481
- He kissed Moss.
- Right on the lips, apparently.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,447
- Don't you remember?
- No. I went to "Moss's happy place".

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,884
You two are useless. If we'd stuck together,
we might have made some real money.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,287
£550 is not to be sniffed at, Jen.

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,361
No, and neither's £560. I tell you,
if that's the kind of money I can make,

54
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,484
I'm going to start dressing
even more provocatively.

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,810
- You can save some of that for Freddie.
- What? What's this?

56
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,448
You know this. Freddie, who did the charity
thing where he tied the balloons to the chair.

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,961
- Oh, yeah.
- Such a lovely idea...

58
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,209
floating from London to Glasgow
to promote optimism.

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,084
Anyway, there's a collection for his wife
and kids, so you'd both better cough up.

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,603
Moss, what would be an appropriate amount
to give to Freddie's wife and kids?

61
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,802
I suppose normally about £5.

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,891
But seeing as
we just got all that money, £50?

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,085
That seems fair.
Let's split the difference and call it a tenner.

64
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,168
Hello?

65
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,243
Hello?

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,328
Douglas, I know this is you.

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,082
Aargh!Jesus, this bloody thing!

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,967
Are you all right, Olive?
You look a bit peaky.

69
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,765
Yes, I'm...
I don't feel up to it any more.

70
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,486
I feel sort of dizzy all of a sudden.

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,648
Well, you're terrifically old.

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,321
But don't worry,
not long now until you're at peace.

73
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,603
I've done it!
Oh! I've done it.

74
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,246
I'm up against the boss now.

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,843
It's a giant spider shooting out
all these little baby spiders. That's brilliant.

76
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,804
- I'm going nowhere down here.
- Nowhere.

77
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,925
I'm going to... Where's Moss?
I'm going to finish this bitch off, Moss!

78
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,567
- It's a dead end.
- They don't come any deader.

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,763
OK, sweetcheeks,
here comes the pain!

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,647
You guys, do you even need
a relationship manager?

81
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,127
Stay down! Stay down, bitch!

82
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,682
I'm dead! Oh!

83
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,768
No, exactly, Jen.

84
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,009
No of fence, but I object to the idea
we even need management,

85
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,920
like we're a pair of nitwits
that don't know how to take care of ourselves.

86
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,805
- It's insulting is what it is.
- Yeah.

87
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,321
Yeah... I suppose you're right.

88
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,481
- Sandwich.
- Oh, right.

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,887
- Coffee.
- What? No, no, no!

90
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,684
Got you!
That one's empty, this is the real one.

91
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,521
I've been planning that for ages.
The look on your face!

92
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,521
- Jen?
- Yeah?

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,401
Don't come in here for a bit.

94
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,210
- Why haven't you put on a clean T-shirt?
- I don't have a spare.

95
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,642
- Someone's looking for help on 10, so...
- No, Moss can do it.

96
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,842
Moss can't do it.
He's slightly concussed.

97
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,202
- Yeah, all right, I'll go.
- I won't be here this afternoon.

98
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,369
- I've got a job interview.
- Oh.

99
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,562
OK. Good for you, Jen - seriously.

100
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,887
We don't need a manager -
it's a non-job.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,367
So you go out there
and you knock 'em dead.

102
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,366
Hello, Jen!

103
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,970
It's Moss.

104
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,048
From work?

105
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,208
For God's sake!

106
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,321
Twats!

107
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,643
- What happened?
- She collapsed. I phoned for an ambulance.

108
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,969
- Give us your jacket, mate.
- What?

109
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,926
- She looks cold.
- She doesn't look cold.

110
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,441
What?! Just give us your jacket.

111
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,166
She's fine!
You're fine, aren't you, Olive?

112
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,644
- She's moving about.
- Ohhhh!

113
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,569
And she's talking.

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,570
That's it, keep the spirits up, Olive.

115
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,729
- I'm cold!
- It's all in your head, Olive.

116
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,205
- Your jacket.
- What?

117
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,288
Come on.

118
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,131
Hurry up.

119
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,004
Thank you.

120
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,011
Right. Come on. Here we go.

121
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,890
Hell's teeth!
I'm not aroused. It's only cars.

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,561
God...damn these electric sex pants!

123
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,884
Check you out, mate!

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,961
Isn't it just so funny and interesting
that I don't have a shirt on?!

125
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,001
Oh, hello!
Let's all make hilarious comments about it.

126
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,568
Everyone? Excuse me. Erm...

127
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,568
As you know,
they found Freddie's body yesterday.

128
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,170
I don't...

129
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,842
There's nothing I can say
that'll make that fact any less horrible.

130
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,683
But perhaps we can... bow our heads
for a minute and think about Freddie

131
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,167
and remember what he meant to us.

132
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,683
Hey, everybody, look at me!

133
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,042
Huh?

134
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,049
Let's get it over with.

135
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,051
Let's all have a big laugh
at the topless man!

136
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,565
Look at me!
Ooh, look at me, I have no shirt.

137
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,409
Where's my clothes?

138
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,648
Ooh, look at these fellas!

139
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,890
Aren't I sexy?
Sexy in my nakedness.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,403
We're in the middle of a minute's silence -
Freddie's body was found.

141
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,444
If you can give us a couple of minutes.

142
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,128
I work here!
I fucking work here!

143
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,480
Ow! Ow!

144
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,841
OK. All right.

145
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,928
Ow!

146
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,168
OK!

147
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,608
I work in IT!

148
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,688
My pass is in my jacket.

149
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,888
My pass is in my jacket!

150
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,081
You bastards!

151
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,804
I work here!

152
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,490
It's madness!

153
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,847
- Lovely cup of tea.
- Ah, thank you.

154
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,606
Well, I have to say,
I like what I see, Jen.

155
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,644
You're young, ambitious, intelligent -

156
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,001
just the sort of person
I like to have around.

157
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,202
Ha-ha-ha!

158
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,120
Well, I'm no Stephen Hawkins,
don't get me wrong,

159
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,325
but you can't work
as long as I have in IT

160
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,762
without having a pretty firm grasp
of the essentials.

161
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,325
You know,
what exactly does "IT" stand for?

162
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,523
I've often wondered,
but I never thought to ask.

163
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,121
I'm sorry, what was the question?

164
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,447
What does "IT" stand for?

165
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,528
What does it stand for?

166
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,847
What doesn't it stand for!

167
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,725
Yes, yes, but what does it stand for?

168
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,763
It stands for...

169
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,761
It stands for... commitment.

170
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,724
It stands for audacity.

171
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,446
It stands for courage in the face of...

172
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,166
Yes, yes.
I can see what you're getting at.

173
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,366
But the specific letters, I-T,
what do they stand for?

174
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,961
- What do you think they stand for?
- Perhaps I'm not making myself clear.

175
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,651
- I'm not looking for an interpretation.
- Oh.

176
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,570
I really don't know
what the letters actually stand for.

177
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,411
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.
- So let's start with the I.

178
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,682
What does the I stand for?

179
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,804
- I... need to wee-wee.
- What?

180
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,127
I mean "go to the toilet".

181
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,245
Sorry, I don't normally say "wee-wee".
It's just I'm bursting.

182
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,045
Hello, Roy speaking.

183
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,006
What?! Moss? You're still concussed.
You need to see the doctor.

184
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,010
Who is this? Roy?
Wait, it couldn't be Roy - I'm Roy.

185
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,726
- Look, look, what does "IT" mean?
- What?

186
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,922
"IT" - what does it mean?
Someone asked me.

187
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,283
- You don't know what it means?
- No, I never thought to ask.

188
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,290
- This must be Jen.
- Yes.

189
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,164
- Hello, Jen!
- Hello.

190
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,205
- How may I help you?
- Ohhh... Tell me what "IT" means.

191
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,288
Absolutely.

192
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,847
- Well?
- Very well, thank you. How are you?

193
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,170
Moss, just stay with me
for this simple question...

194
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,489
- I'm just going to put you on speakerphone.
- No, don't hang up!

195
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,725
Jen, you are now on speakerphone.

196
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,043
Jen?

197
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,765
Hello, Jen?

198
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,522
Jen, bear with me one moment. Someone's
trying to get through on the other line.

199
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,608
- Roy speaking.
- You just hung up on me.

200
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,088
- Hold on a sec. Jen's on the other line.
- No!

201
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,682
Jen, can I call you back?
Jen's trying to get through on the other line.

202
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,848
Jen, sorry about that.

203
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,124
Chicken in a basket!
It has been all ruddy go today.

204
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,928
Now, how may I help you?

205
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,884
What does "IT" mean?!

206
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,524
You know, computers -
something to do with computers probably.

207
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,201
Computers?
That's not really my area.

208
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,926
Jen, I'd love to help you,
but it's a real pain -

209
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,726
I seem to have forgotten
absolutely everything I know about computers.

210
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,081
How can you forget everything you know?

211
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,363
Let me see.
Maybe it isn't everything.

212
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,242
No, it's definitely everything.

213
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,287
Excuse me, could I trouble you
for 50 pence for a phone call?

214
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,442
Excuse me, mate.
I'm sorry to bother you, but, erm...

215
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,927
my mate threw coffee all over me,

216
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,486
then this old woman stole my jacket,

217
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,285
and they chucked me out
of the building where I work.

218
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,122
And now I just need 50p for a phone call
so I can get back to work.

219
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,608
Oh, that's better.

220
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,768
Good, good.

221
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,848
Now, erm... where were we?

222
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,928
Oh, God, I can't remember.

223
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,122
I hate it when that happens.

224
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,811
Wow! Is this a wooden desk?

225
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,364
Oh, no, I remember,
you were going to tell me what "IT" means.

226
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,642
Right.

227
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,442
I don't know what it means, all right?

228
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,325
I never thought to...
It didn't really affect me.

229
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,410
I'm too busy managing one man
whose idea of an adult night out

230
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,887
is Laser Quest followed by pornography,

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,367
and another who collects wires.

232
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,689
Have you heard Guided By Voices?
They're a band.

233
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,325
- No.
- I have.

234
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,727
I've heard everything they've ever done.

235
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,968
They're good.
I'm a bit of a fan now.

236
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,529
- Isn't that good?
- I shouldn't even know who they are!

237
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,688
They've turned me into one of them.

238
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,601
I am one of them.

239
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,444
That's why you need me.

240
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,608
I am your conduit.

241
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,451
I am your bridge.

242
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,610
Ich. Bin. Ein. Nerd.

243
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,601
Welcome aboard.

244
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,087
How can that be erotic?!
Good God!

245
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,488
Get me IT.

246
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,525
You there, computer man,
fix my pants.

247
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,087
- Beg your pardon?
- Pull down my trousers and do your job.

248
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,844
Roy?!

249
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,928
Jen?

250
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,809
Jen!

251
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,008
Oh, Jen!

252
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,767
Oh, Jen!

253
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,480
- Oh, Jen!
- Get off me.

254
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,126
It's been horrible!

255
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,131
Horrible! The worst two hours of my life!

256
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,241
All right... Hello, everybody,

257
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,491
and welcome to this, our first inter-faith tour
of Reynholm Industries.

258
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,924
I thought we'd start with
the IT department because,

259
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,407
to be honest,
we tend to forget about them a bit,

260
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,488
buried down here in the basement,

261
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,682
and they really are lovely guys.

262
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,202
- Let's go in and say hello.
-  But I don't know what it is.

263
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,881
Just pull that thing there,
fiddle about with it.

264
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,488
Fuck off!

265
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,441
- Try that wire.
- Who are you?

266
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,481
I'm free at last.

267
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,523
I could get to like these.

268
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,802
Just the job. Good work.

269
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,888
Mmm! Nice and loose.

270
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,085
I'm in my happy place. I'm in my happy place.
I'm in my happy place. I'm in my happy place.

271
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,282
I'm in my happy place.
I'm in my happy place.

272
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,884
- Hello?
- Hello, June.

273
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,446
Jen! Hello.
How can I help you?

274
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,201
Thank you, but I'm going
to have to turn your offer down.

275
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,290
Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Why?

276
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,165
- Personal reasons.
- OK.

277
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,806
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where I am.

278
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,403
- Thank you.
- Did you ever find out what "IT" stands for?

279
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,602
Piss off, June.

280
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,684
Who wants tea?
