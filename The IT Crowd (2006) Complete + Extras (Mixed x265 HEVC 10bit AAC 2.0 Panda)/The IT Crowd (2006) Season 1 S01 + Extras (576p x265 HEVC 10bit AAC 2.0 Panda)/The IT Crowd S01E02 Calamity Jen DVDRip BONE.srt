00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,250
<i>Has this ever happened to you?</i>

2
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,728
<i>Ohh! Argh!</i>

3
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,081
<i>From today dialing 999
won't get you the emergency services.</i>

4
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,044
<i>And that's not the only
thing that's changing.</i>

5
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,290
<i>Nicer ambulances, faster response times,
and better-looking drivers</i>

6
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,721
<i>mean they're not just
"the" emergency services -</i>

7
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,640
<i>they're "your" emergency services.
So, remember the new number:</i>

8
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,484
<i>That's...</i>

9
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,602
<i>Hello?</i>

10
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,688
<i>I've had a bit of a tumble.</i>

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,609
Well, that's easy to remember.

00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,530

16
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,525
I don't know why they just couldn't keep it
as it was. How hard is it to remember 911?

17
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,971
- You mean <i>999.</i>
- I mean <i>999!</i>

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,809
- That's the American one.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,969
- You berk!
- Come on, are you ready?

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,089
No, honestly, it's fine. There are
so many shoes in the world, you know.

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,000
They are beautiful, I love them. In fact they're
the most beautiful shoes I've ever seen,

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,851
but I can't have everything I love,
otherwise I'd own lots of things.

23
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,045
And actually they're red, which is quite tarty,
and they don't go with any of my outfits...

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,688
- Shh! Shh! Come on, you crazy bitch.
- ..although they do go with most of them.

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,690
- Come on. Denholm's called a general.
- Oh, God! Another one?

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,885
- Yeah.
- I bet he declares war on something.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,810
He loves declaring war.

28
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,606
I am declaring war!

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,170
I can see that got your attention.

30
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,803
What am I declaring war on?

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,446
My bollocks?

32
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,927
Stress!

33
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,045
Stress is a disease, people.
And I am the cure.

34
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,609
I'm a doctor with a cure. No, I'm not.
I'm a general, and it's still a war!

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,643
A war on disease - stress!

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,524
There's too much stress around here...

37
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,086
<i>They're very expensive,
and besides, the woman in the shop</i>

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,682
<i>said they were way too small for me,
so, you know, be practical. Grow up.</i>

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,362
In the time I've been speaking,
over 80 million people have died of stress.

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,443
That's another one.

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,170
That's another one.

42
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,362
More.

43
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,165
Mayhem!
We've got to deal with it.

44
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,882
- Are you ready to deal with it?
- Yeah!

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,002
- Say "I hate stress".
- I hate stress.

46
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,088
No, you didn't let me finish.

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,684
Say I hate stress, and I want to limit its
influence in my life. What can I do about it?

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,768
Anyone?

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,087
Have a bath?

50
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,282
Have a bath? Get a bike!

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,809
I cycle to work every day - <i>70</i> miles.

52
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,050
Both here and here
are as red as a fire engine.

53
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,925
Any other ideas?

54
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,883
- Jen, what about you?
- Shoes.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,685
- What?
- Shoes.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,370
What? Shoes...

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,850
OK, look. I have invited Dr Julian Holmes
to come and give a class at lunchtime.

58
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,249
He is Europe's leading stress expert.
They call them "stressperts".

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,287
Anyone interested in coming along, picking
up a few tips on how to manage <i>stress?</i>

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,247
There's a free buffet.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,321
Good. Good, people.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,562
Oh. By the way, anyone still
experiencing stress at the end of the day

63
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,001
will be fired!

64
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,401
- It's not going on.
- Yeah, I think it is, though.

65
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,330
- Just angle it a bit more.
- Are you sure you're a five?

66
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,681
- I'm not a liar.
- Yeah, but I mean, I can't...

67
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,607
Just... I can feel the heel going into
the shoe. Just angle it a bit more.

68
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,451
- There is no angle that I could...
- Don't let me push you away.

69
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,370
Just lean in with the shoe.
Lean in with the shoe!

70
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,329
We have been here for half an hour.

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,206
The shoes aren't going on.
They are two sizes too small,

72
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,449
and even if they did go on,
they would cripple you.

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,528
You don't want that, do you?

74
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,841
I myself have been subject
to some terrible rages...

75
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,247
Yes?

76
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,727
I'm sorry. Is this the stress class?

77
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,525
- Oh, yeah. Come on in.
- Thank you.

78
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,559
Moss!

79
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,639
Come on in.

80
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,166
It's in here!

81
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,248
Moss!

82
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,608
Sorry.

83
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,602
Um... Sorry.

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,490
All right.

85
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,364
Thank you. It's no problem.

86
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,482
Argh!

87
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,369
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,689
Um... As I was saying, uh,

89
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,644
I myself have been subject
to some terrible rages,

90
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,766
where I've snapped at my wife,
or spoken harshly to a work colleague,

91
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,042
because of stress.

92
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,768
In fact, just thinking about it
now, I realise I'm raising my voice,

93
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,326
so I'm sorry.

94
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,287
Stress is the main cause of heart attacks,
and even a little bit can...

95
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,209
Well...

96
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,288
Let me show you what stress can do.

97
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,251
I'm going to need a volunteer.

98
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,089
Yes. Come on up.

99
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,603
That's fine.
Can I have your left hand there?

100
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,961
Sit back, and just relax.

101
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,562
I'm going to ask you
a very personal question.

102
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,211
You see? It's all right,
I'm not going to ask you anything at all.

103
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,723
That's just to show how little is needed
to send our stress levels shooting up.

104
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,322
Just a simple statement like that has
registered very strongly on the display.

105
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,851
- Another volunteer?
- Yeah.

106
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,645
OK. I'll just take this off there...

107
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,364
I'm gonna kill you!

108
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,404
There it goes! Yes!
Right up! Look at that.

109
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,491
Brilliant. Brilliant. Excellent.
It's a super machine.

110
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,250
- Wow. Great shoes.
- Thank you very much.

111
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,285
I really envy women with dainty feet.
What are you, a five?

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,368
Yes.

113
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,441
Well, just a little, um,
misunderstanding there, I should imagine.

114
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,086
- So let's move on. I...
- Whoa!

115
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,601
I actually haven't had a proper go yet.

116
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,001
I don't think that that should count,
what happened there.

117
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,969
Actually, I don't think that's fair.

118
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,880
I would like a go, and I think Roy should
be punished for nearly killing that lady.

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,004
- Well, I think I should go first.
- I don't think so. Let's move on.

120
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,441
- When did you grow your beard?
- A little go.

121
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,800
- Just one little weeny go.
- Are you very old?

122
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,968
Let's move on!

123
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,808
Oh, shut up!

124
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,766
- What are you eating?
- Muffin.

125
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,966
A muffin? How can you be hungry? You ate
a whole chicken at the stress buffet.

126
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,445
- What's that?
- Oh.

127
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,565
I've made a stress machine to try out
on myself, like the one in that class.

128
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,364
Watch this.

129
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,723
I'm going to ask myself
a very personal question.

130
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,087
Don't worry. I'm not really
going to ask myself any questions.

131
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,883
Dead good. Not as good
as the one in the stress class.

132
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,364
The shoes!

133
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,161
What was all that about?

134
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,365
- Well, like all women, she's shoe mad.
- That's a bit sexist, isn't it?

135
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,642
Do you know one woman
who isn't obsessed with shoes?

136
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,324
No. But I only know one woman. And she just
left the room shouting, "The shoes!"

137
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,401
Aaaaargh!

138
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,690
The needle's freaking out!

139
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,527
Try not to hurt yourself.

140
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,090
- Moss?
- Yeah?

141
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,044
Did you use a soldering iron
to make that stress machine?

142
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,367
- Yes.
- You turned it off?

143
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,245
Oh, I'm fairly sure I did.

144
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,809
Because you remember
what happened last time, right?

145
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,888
Yes. That was very funny.

146
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,128
Well, no, no.

147
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,767
It was very dangerous,
and someone nearly died.

148
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,329
Right. No. Yeah, I was thinking of a different
incident, the one on the golf course.

149
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,329
What?

150
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,410
- I'm talking about the fire.
- Oh, yeah. Fire. Sorry.

151
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,808
I always get mixed up
between "golf" and "fire".

152
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,606
- Just make sure it's off.
- It is off, I think.

153
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,167
- Well, just make sure it is.
- I will make sure it is.

154
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,726
And if it's already off...

155
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,641
I'll just walk away.

156
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,285
Get off my back.
What is he, the soldering iron police?

157
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,890
It's... off.

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,765
That means I turn it on,

159
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,042
and just walk away.

160
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,207
Oh! Four! I mean, five!

161
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,482
I mean, fire!

162
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,044
Now, let's see what we have here.

163
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,128
"Stand upright."

164
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,524
Now I can't read it.

165
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,406
Oh! Not me. I <i>am</i> a giddy goat.

166
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,770
OK. "Remove safety clip."

167
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,688
- Don't look at my feet.
- Fire?

168
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,244
Fire?

169
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,850
No?

170
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,601
"Aim nozzle at base of fire."

171
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,370
Oh! That is <i>typical.</i>

172
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,324
Why's it done that?

173
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,008
Oh...

174
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,448
Uh...

175
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,723
I'll just put this over here
with the rest... of the fire.

176
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,164
Um...

177
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,520
<i>♪</i> 0-1-1-5-3...

178
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,005

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,171
Hello? Is this the emergency services?

184
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,526
Then which country <i>am</i> I speaking to?

185
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,369
Hello? Hello?

186
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,528
I know. Yeah.

187
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,805
OK.

188
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,886
Fire.

189
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,684
Dear Sir/Madam,

190
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,044
I am writing to inform you of a fire
which has broken out at the premises of...

191
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,128
No, that's too formal.

192
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,041
Dear Sir/Madam,
Fire, exclamation mark.

193
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,527
Fire, exclamation mark.

194
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,211
Help me, exclamation mark.

195
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,687
123 Carenden Road.

196
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,280
Looking forward to hearing from you.

197
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,926
All the best, Maurice Moss.

198
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,165
What were you wearing size five shoes for,
woman? You're at least an eight.

199
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,248
Eight?! How dare you?

200
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,647
That foot is completely mangled.

201
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,761
And the other one's even worse.

202
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,408
- You're not wearing these again.
- But I threw away my other shoes.

203
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,682
What am I supposed to wear?

204
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,247
Hello. Hello!

205
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,603
D'you remember me?
Can I have a go on your machine now?

206
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,484
- Hello again.
- Oh, hi.

207
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,847
Please thank Yamamoto-San
for this fine ceremonial sword.

208
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,611
It is a magnificent
symbol of our new merger.

209
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,725
I am sorry that my gift,
a huge pair of Doc Martens,

210
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,129
with extremely thick and heavy soles,
is so paltry in comparison.

211
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,807
Please rest assured that my cultural adviser
will be fired as soon as this meeting is over.

212
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,086
- These are very heavy shoes.
- Yes.

213
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,724
He feels like Godzilla.

214
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,288
Does he? Godzilla?
Go on, stamp your feet.

215
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,449
Clap him, man. Good.

216
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,289
The Jap loves it.

217
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,767
Go on. Break something!

218
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,568
Put your weight into it!

219
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,040
You idiot!

220
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,562
- What are you doing?!
- You stupid old <i>!</i>

221
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,288
You twat! What, you think
you're a big man shoes?!

222
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,804
- Well, you're not!
- You're nothing but a <i>!</i>

223
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,171
I am so sorry, Denholm.

224
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,248
That was quite a tirade, Jen.

225
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,968
It would have been even worse if Paul hadn't
been so quick on the profanity buzzer.

226
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,084
Well done, Paul.
You're back on the payroll.

227
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,567
As for you, you fucked up.

228
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,651
Shouting at Japs, mad feet -
both classic signs of stress.

229
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,081
And you know how I feel about stress.

230
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,567
Go to your office, and wait for me.

231
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,086
The weirdest thing just happened...

232
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,521
Fire! Fire!

233
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,041
I've sent an email. It's fine.

234
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,447
An email?!
It's a fire! Where...?

235
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,931
Where's the bisting... the bistinguisher?

236
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,724
How...?

237
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,922
"Made in Britain".

238
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,249
- This is just like the golf incident.
- You mean the fire incident.

239
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,409
- Of course I mean the fire incident.
- What have you got there?

240
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,447
I'm in trouble. I've got to get my shoes on.
Help me get them on before Denholm comes.

241
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,962
- Denholm's coming?
- Yeah, and he's gonna fire... Fire! Fire!

242
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,607
I've taken care of it.
I have to say,

243
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,088
I feel a little bit insulted by the
lack of faith you're both displaying.

244
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,885
- What happened to your feet?!
- What is this?

245
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,289
I think a fire in the office demands a little
more attention than my feet, don't you?

246
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,246
- How did you get the stress machine, Roy?
- Um... Don't really know.

247
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,284
Met Dr Holmes by the lifts...

248
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,971
Wasn't he nice?
I thought he was a lovely man.

249
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,050
Yeah, I thought he was a delight.
But I met him there by the lifts,

250
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,767
and he just went <i>mental.</i>

251
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,850
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh, one thing led to another,

252
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,167
and I just... I stole it.

253
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,248
- You stole it?
- Yeah.

254
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,560
But that's stealing!

255
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,810
Yeah. Didn't know what a stress machine was
this morning, and now we have two of them.

256
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,969
I hate to remind everyone,
but I've just destroyed a merger

257
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,766
that probably took hundreds of years
to set up, the office is on fire,

258
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,043
Denholm is furious, so can we please
concentrate on what's important,

259
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,162
and help me on with my shoes?!

260
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,760
Going to get into trouble.

261
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,291
Empty.

262
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,686
Agh!

263
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,962
Got a little bit there.

264
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,721
Oh, no... Wait!
Now, these are a size five.

265
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,242
- What are you, eight and a half?
- Shut up.

266
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,566
- Come on.
- I'm pushing!

267
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,286
- Push it on, don't pull it away!
- Is it in?

268
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,243
Come on! Push hard!

269
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,691
Go! Wah!

270
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,962
Oh, God!

271
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,641
- The heel went right through.
- Oh, my God. It hurts so much.

272
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,445
God! Oh, now I'm bleeding. Good!

273
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,767
<i>Jen!</i> Where are you, Jen?

274
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,451
- It's Denholm.
- What?!

275
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,884
- Hide the stress machine!
- The stress machine? What about the fire?

276
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,002
OK, put the stress machine in Jen's room.

277
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,088
- He'll never go in there.
- What if he does?

278
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,487
It doesn't matter!
He won't know what it is.

279
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,207
I can't go to prison, Roy.
They'll rape the flip out of me.

280
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,603
- You stall him by the door.
- Stall him... How?

281
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,850
I don't know. Use your womanly ways.
Moss, pass me that monitor, the broken one.

282
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,846
- There you are.
- Hello, there.

283
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,361
It's no use being womanly with me, Jen.

284
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,006
You're in big trouble.

285
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,162
Nice screen saver.

286
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,288
Thank you.

287
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,166
Aha! A stress machine.

288
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,805
Just what we need.

289
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,605
Roll up your sleeves, Jen.
Let's get this over with.

290
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,165
It's a one-way ticket to Slammertown
for us, Roy, with no return ticket.

291
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,726
I really am losing quite a lot of blood.

292
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,207
You understand this is your last chance?
If the needle goes beyond here,

293
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,368
you will be fired.

294
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,448
Does that make you feel stressed?

295
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,528
Jen! Does it?

296
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,086
No? Are you sure? Are you sure?

297
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,248
Are you sure? Are you sure?

298
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,801
Are you sure? Are you sure?

299
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,202
Are you sure? Are you sure?

300
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,602
Are you sure? Are you sure?

301
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,002
Are you sure? Are you sure?

302
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,570
I'll level with you, Roy. I don't think
I'd flourish in a prison environment.

303
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,328
Can I try on your glasses?

304
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,161
See this balloon, Jen? I'm going to burst
it. But I'm not going to tell you when.

305
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,127
Do you feel stressed, Jen? Jen! Jen!

306
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,527
Look at that.

307
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,008
That's your peace of mind,
and it's gonna go bang.

308
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,408
Do you feel stressed now, Jen?
Jen? Jen? Jen?

309
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,488
Jen? Jen?

310
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,568
Do you?

311
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,325
Evidently not.

312
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,085
Well done, Jen. You're not being
fired by me at this precise moment.

313
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,601
I love the way the smoke seems to be
coming off the top of it.

314
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,767
Just a second...

315
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,802
I'm late for golf!

316
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,447
I wonder why it didn't work.

317
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,449
Ah...

318
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,043
I don't know if it's the loss of blood
or the melting plastic from the monitor,

319
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,731
but I feel great.

320
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,805
It's ironic, but this entire situation
has been quite stressful.

321
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,482
I'll get help.

322
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,486
Did someone email us about a fire?
