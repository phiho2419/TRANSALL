1
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,447
I could have brought it in tomorrow,
you know.

2
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,289
You didn't have to follow me home.

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,641
Jen, I know what it's like,
lending money.

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,808
You do not want it hanging over you.

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,641
It's better I just get it back now
before it becomes this big thing between us.

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,243
You gave it to me two hours ago
and you literally haven't left my side since!

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,445
I am never going to borrow money
off you again. You're a nightmare.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,360
- There, £5. God!
- Thanking you.

9
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,051
- Hi, Jen.
- Oh, Gary, hi. How's it going?

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,607
- Good. I've finished that first wall.
- Great. That was quick.

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,882
Gary's doing a bit of work around the house.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,002
Hello.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,523
- Have we met?
- Er... no, I don't think so.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,404
- You just look...
- Oh...

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,000
- I'd better crack on.
- OK.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,645
- Bye, Roy.
- He's...

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,889
- Yeah, all right. Time to go.
- I don't think...

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,526
- Get out.
- No, wait! Wait.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,961
It can wait till tomorrow.

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,606
- Hey, where are you going?
- Nice glasses, mate!

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,564
You look a right old muppet in them!

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,244
- Why didn't you tell me this last night?
- You wouldn't let me.

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,685
- Builders From Hell ?!
- I'm sure it was one of those programmes.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,246
- Gary's a builder from hell?
- I think so.

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,330
- Oh, so you're not sure?
- Jen, I'm 99% sure.

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,761
Well... what did he do?

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,771
The work was fine,
there was nothing wrong with the work,

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,201
but then they caught him...

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,128
- He pissed in the sink.
- Oh! Oh!

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,571
Yeah...

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,569
- Which sink?
- All the sinks.

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,886
Oh!

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,765
Yeah, he basically
went on a pee parade around the house.

34
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,963
- Oh, God, I have to fire him.
- I think you should, yeah.

35
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,128
I'm 95% sure it was him.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,371
You... you said you were 99% sure.

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,211
I'm 97% sure it was him.

38
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,483
I-I have to get home.
I have to get home.

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,848
Hey, man.

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,522
- You OK?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,608
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,765
Wait. Was it those bullies again?

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,848
Yeah.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,168
Oh. What do they do exactly?

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,726
They make hurtful comments, Roy.

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,491
You have to learn
how to stand up for yourself, man.

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,082
OK, let's try something.
Let's do some role play, OK?

48
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,081
- Do you think that would be a good idea?
- It helped me learn how to buy sandwiches.

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,440
OK.

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,246
Let's go for it, OK?
So, I'll be those bullies on the bench.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,887
- What, all of them?
- No, just one of them.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,844
- Which one?
- I don't know them, Moss.

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,043
I'm a bully on the bench,
and you're going to walk past me.

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,051
But this time,
after I make a "hurtful comment",

55
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,208
come back at me with something, OK?

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,288
Get all up in my shit.

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,170
All right? OK.

58
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,204
Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait.
What do they usually say?

59
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,405
- They mention my glasses.
- OK, let's start with that.

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,127
Them glasses is shit, innit?

61
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,205
It's too real, Roy!
It's too real!

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,448
- I won't do the voice.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,766
OK.

64
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,204
OK.

65
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,448
- Nice glasses.
- Oh, yeah, er...

66
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,246
..maybe the reason
I have to wear glasses

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,601
is because I suffer from short-sightedness

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,644
and I can't... I won't...
I can't put contact lenses in

69
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,570
cos I'm frightened of touching my eyes.

70
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,851
I can't... There's no way that th-these
glasses... I can't... And there's no...

71
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,849
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,642
Stupid hair!

73
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,879
Mr Reynholm,
you seem to lack a basic understanding

74
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,167
Mr Reynholm,
you seem to lack a basic understanding

75
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,886
of exactly how much trouble
this company's in!

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,650
We have a financial crisis here,

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,129
and if you don't mind me saying,
your attitude seems to me incredibly cavalier.

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,846
What?

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,726
I can't hear you.
Can't you see we're having an iPod party?

80
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,003
- Mr Reynholm, please!
- What?

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,284
Sorry girls, you'd better go.

82
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,808
Girls, ship it!

83
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,326
Best accounting team I've ever had.

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,081
- What's your problem?
- This. The iPod parties are the problem.

85
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,364
The gold flakes in the drinking water
are the problem.

86
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,642
The obscene amount you spend on erotic art.

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,766
- Easy there! That's an original.
- Do you know how much trouble we're in?

88
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,690
Do you know what the shareholders
are going to do with us?

89
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,044
- I'm sorry, but you were getting hysterical.
- No, I wasn't!

90
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,844
- You seemed hysterical.
- No!

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,009
Anyway, don't worry about the shareholders.
I can handle them.

92
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,728
But you've missed every meeting with them
for seven weeks. Where were you last time?

93
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,923
You're going to hate me for this,
but I fancied the day off,

94
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,089
so I took some of the pension money
out of the bank

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,931
and I lost it on a horse.

96
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,565
Yes!

97
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,843
- Gambling with our employees' pensions?
- Gambling? No.

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,167
I was riding the horse -
it fell out of my pocket.

99
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,523
Oh, my God!
I'm not hysterical!

100
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,684
Hi, Gary.

101
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,564
Oh, hello.

102
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,010
I thought I'd work from home today.

103
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,522
Sorry, bit out of breath.

104
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,248
Hope you don't mind.

105
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,965
No. Not at all.

106
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,047
Oh! I'm sorry to interrupt you, but
you said you had a problem with your laptop.

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,130
- Mind if IT fiddle about while we speak?
- Well, actually, I...

108
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,924
Yeah, no, good.

109
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,008
I can't seem to get it open.

110
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,247
You want me to open it?!

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,001
That's why you called me all the way up here,
to open your laptop?!

112
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,285
I would be beholden to you.

113
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,408
No problem.

114
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,171
- Given the delicate nature of our...
-  Money, money, money!

115
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,046
That's the problem with you people -
it's always about money.

116
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,925
Roy, give me £20.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,446
- What?
- Give me £20. I'll pay you back.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,968
Yeah, er...

119
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,208
You know what I think of money?

120
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,445
- Oh!
- That's what I think of money.

121
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,528
Ah, you've opened it.

122
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,728
Thanks, Roy.

123
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,210
You're welcome.

124
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,641
You do know Japan have expressed concern?

125
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,161
What, the whole country?

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,209
No, not the whole...
Mr Yamamoto.

127
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,405
- He's important, isn't he?
- He's the major shareholder.

128
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,488
He's effectively your partner.

129
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,447
He said, "I do hope we do not have
our own Conrad Black at Reynholm Industries."

130
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,842
Conrad Black - the first rich person
to go to prison in 300 years.

131
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,247
- You see it's serious?
- What do you want from me?

132
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,251
I want you to stay out of trouble.
Do nothing until the conference call tomorrow.

133
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,244
Let me get this right.
You want me to do absolutely nothing?

134
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,727
Just stay out of trouble -
that's all I ask.

135
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,684
You want me to sit on my arse all day?

136
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,881
I think I can handle that.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,766
I don't think I've ever looked in this drawer.

138
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,608
Wow! A gun!

139
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,728
Roy, I'd love to take you through

140
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,003
my changes to the video-conferencing
system in the meeting room,

141
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,327
but maybe I'm boring you.

142
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,607
- I'll never see that £20 again!
- I can't believe you're not interested

143
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,371
in the sweet flip switch I've installed.

144
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,929
£20 doesn't even register to him
as an amount of money!

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,764
He won't remember it.

146
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,930
IT. Have you tried turning it...

147
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,807
Is this the guy? I need to know.
I can't sit here all day staring at him.

148
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,163
It really looked like him, Jen.
I'm 80% sure it's him.

149
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,766
- Are you winding me up?!
- What?

150
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,848
You've gone down 15%!

151
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,564
It's still high.

152
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,641
I am sitting here like an idiot,
and you've gone down about 15%!

153
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,402
Jen, how can you be keeping an eye on him
while you're talking to me as well?

154
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,929
- Hi, Gary.
- All right?

155
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,081
Sorry, I thought you were in the toilet.

156
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,727
I just wondered, erm...
if you fancied a cup of tea.

157
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,608
- Just made you one.
- Oh, yeah.

158
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,087
Great. Thanks.

159
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,683
- So how's it all going?
- I've finished that other wall.

160
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,290
Great.

161
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,006
And that architrave
ain't going to be a problem.

162
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,648
- And the eggshell's come up really well.
- Yeah, it's classy. It's really good.

163
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,128
Thank you for the cup of tea.

164
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,526
Oh, I should probably do that.

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,401
Dear Douglas,
if you're reading this,

166
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,208
- you've found my father's service revolver.
- Hell's horses!

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,324
I did plan on using this gun
to take my own life, if it came to it,

168
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,808
but as you know,
in the end I jumped out of a window.

169
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,242
I pass it on to you in the hope
that if things ever get too bad,

170
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,442
You'll be able to take the easy way out.

171
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,291
Hopefully it won't come to it,
but ifit does,

172
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,041
promise me that you'll shoot yourself
without a moment's hesitation.

173
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,128
I promise, Father.

174
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,608
Your affectionate father, Mr Reynholm.

175
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,568
I wonder if it's loaded.

176
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,849
No.

177
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,689
Ah!

178
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,882
Here we go.

179
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,489
- You off somewhere?
- Erm, yeah.

180
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,681
Yeah?

181
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,043
So, er... what's next on the agenda?

182
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,730
- Look, Jen, I know what's going on.
- You do?

183
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,886
And it's fine.
I understand, I really do.

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,321
Oh, so you understand how I feel.

185
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,489
Yeah, but you are barking up the wrong tree.

186
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,809
I mean, I think you're
a top bird and everything, but...

187
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,001
you're not really my type.

188
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,081
I mean, I like tall... beautiful girls.

189
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,450
I don't fancy you,
you big, ugly builder.

190
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,371
I'm trying to stop you
having a piddle party in my house!

191
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,050
- What?
- Builders From Hell. Ring any bells?

192
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,162
- I don't know what you mean.
- You do.

193
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,080
- I don't.
- You haven't been on Builders From Hell ?

194
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,440
- No, I haven't.
- Oh, really?!

195
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,766
- Yes, really.
- Really?!

196
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,928
Really!

197
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,721
Well... let's forget about it. Shall we?

198
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,642
This conversation's beneath us.

199
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,366
Wow, I love what you've done
to that wall, Gary.

200
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,007
- I haven't done that wall yet.
- You haven't even done it, and I love it!

201
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,488
God, we should...
You and I should stay in touch.

202
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,206
I would like to stay in touch with you...

203
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,406
cos we've got a... a-a-a-a rapport,
haven't... haven't we?

204
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,488
We've clicked.
We have, we've clicked.

205
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,443
Haven't we? In a way.

206
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,331
In a... in a... in a weird way
that friends... friends usually click.

207
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,250
"A big, ugly builder."

208
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,365
You. This is all because of you.

209
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,721
Jen, I didn't bring his weight into it!

210
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,045
You said you were 99% sure.

211
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,130
Oh, I don't think I ever went that high.

212
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,971
I've always thought it was about 60/40.

213
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,407
Now that I think about it, Jen, I'm pretty sure
that the guy on the programme was black.

214
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,089
Well, at least I don't have to worry about him
going on a toilet tour of my house.

215
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,171
Unless he's so angry
that he does it out of spite.

216
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,166
- What?
- If someone called me a "big, ugly builder",

217
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,171
I'd be furious - and not just because
I'm actually an IT consultant.

218
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,485
Revenge, that would be uppermost
upon my mind:

219
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,365
- "I'm going to wee on everything."
- Oh, God!

220
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,051
- "I'm going to taint her abode."
- Oh!

221
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,767
"I'm going to strain my personal potatoes
throughout her premises."

222
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,405
Oh, God!

223
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,881
- Nice glasses!
- Not as nice as your momma's glasses!

224
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,366
It's a little bit complimentary,
but we'll work on it.

225
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,241
I can't hang around the house -
he'll know I don't trust him.

226
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,362
But I can't leave him on his own.

227
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,643
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do, Roy?

228
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,569
Jen, just relax, OK?

229
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,004
I've often found that the best solution
is the simplest.

230
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,050
- Thanks again for doing this, Roy.
- No problem, Jen.

231
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,721
It's brilliantly easy
to spy on people these days.

232
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,287
- He won't see the cameras, will he?
- Oh, no, no.

233
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,562
They're pretty well hidden.

234
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,247
- He's muttering a lot. Have you noticed?
- Mm-hm.

235
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,246
"Fat, ugly builder"!

236
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,887
Take that, lollipop man!

237
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,921
Wow!

238
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,123
My grandfather's old service revolver.

239
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,370
To think of all the deserters
he shot in the head with this!

240
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,682
Are you ready?

241
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,519
- Ready for what?
- Japan!

242
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:48,599


243
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,285
Oh, is that meeting today?
Hell's bells!

244
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,450
- You go ahead.
- I'll be right there. I've just...

245
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,847
What was that?!

246
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,883
- What was what?
- That noise.

247
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,924
- What noise?
- The loud explosion!

248
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,408
Loud explosion?
What on earth are you talking about?!

249
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,569
- You didn't hear that just then?
- What are you talking about?

250
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,925
You come in here, ranting about gunshots
and service revolvers - I've had enough!

251
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,011
Get out! Go!
Go to the meeting. I'll be right there.

252
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,968
Hello. Does someone
have a problem with their laptop?

253
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,610
Now, you listen to me -
this is very important.

254
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,011
I have a vital meeting to attend,
and I've just shot myself in the leg.

255
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,441
Uh-huh?

256
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,561
I want you to dial 999.

257
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,206
No, it's a new number -
# 011...

258
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,766
Whatever the new number is...

259
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,044
get an ambulance and ask it to wait,

260
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,927
and I'll be there in two hours,
three hours tops.

261
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,523
Are you ready?

262
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,122
I was born...  ready.

263
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,768
OK, Roy, we're on.
J'accuse ! Gotcha!

264
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,884
OK, how do you record?
How do you record on this?

265
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,604
Roy?

266
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,610
Roy? Roy, how do you record?

267
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,211
OK... we're on.

268
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,243
Mr Yamamoto, hello.

269
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,131
He is angry!

270
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,600
Well, lots to think about there.
Thoughts, anyone?

271
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,486
No? We'll reconvene tomorrow.
Thank you, everyone.

272
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,126
But... but what did it all mean?

273
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,722
- Mr Reynholm, are you all right?
- I'm fine, yes. Yes, I'm fine.

274
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,207
Erm... I'm going to go.

275
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,800
I may not come back.

276
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,161
But I want to say this:

277
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,521
that accounts team...

278
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,211
I had every last one of them.

279
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,722
Just a little bit further, son.

280
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,491
Father?! Is it really you?

281
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,490
- Is this really heaven?
- Yes, yes. Hurry up, come on.

282
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,286
I'm coming, Father.
I'm ready.

283
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,846
Whoa there!

284
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,008
- Was that Hitler?
- Was what Hitler?

285
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,170
- That looked like Hitler.
- That wasn't Hitler, that was a woman.

286
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,124
Really?
Well, it looked exactly like Hitler.

287
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,562
We're having a heaven party,
and that's a Hitlergram.

288
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,091
Right, well,
I don't think I'm quite ready yet.

289
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,010
- Come on!
- No.

290
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,646
I'll see you later.
I've still got a lot of work to do.

291
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,129
- I'll see you later, Douglas.
- Not if I see you first.

292
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,521
..must call Mark Thatcher...

293
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,128
I'm alive!

294
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,406
Nolan!

295
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,488
My accounting team!

296
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,809
And Roy... gentle, Irish Roy.

297
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,969
Thank you for being by my side
while I awake.

298
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,889
No problem, sir.

299
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,367
We don't want you going anywhere.

300
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,522
Isn't it lucky to see an Irishman when you
awake from a near-death experience?

301
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,281
I've heard that.
Even if it isn't, I appreciate it, Roy,

302
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,847
and I count myself lucky
to have you as a friend.

303
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,683
- He's exhausted. We should go.
- I'll stay with him, make sure he's OK.

304
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,286
Got you, you crafty Irish bastard!

305
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,448
I've got a gun!
I've got a ruddy gun!

306
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,086
I've got a flipping gun!
I've got a flipping gun!

307
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,727
I've got a mother-flipping gun!
I've got a mother-flipping gun!
