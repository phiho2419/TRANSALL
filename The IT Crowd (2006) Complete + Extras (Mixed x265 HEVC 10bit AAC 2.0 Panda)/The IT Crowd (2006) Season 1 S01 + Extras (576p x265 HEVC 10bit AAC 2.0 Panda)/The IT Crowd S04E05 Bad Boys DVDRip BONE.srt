1
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,283
Come on, settle!
The sooner you're settled,

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,562
the sooner this is over with.

3
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,285
Thank you. Now, you're going
to meet some men today

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,131
who've taken a wrong turn
in their lives.

5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,244
They're going to tell you their stories,
and hopefully

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,523
make you think a little bit
about the roads you're going down.

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,768
It's not going to be any kind of fun,

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,360
so you can wipe those smiles
off your faces.

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,250
Right. Now, let's meet
our first speaker.

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,647
What the flip are you looking at?
You think this is funny?

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,491
You think this is some kind of
mother-flipping joke?

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,002
Mother-flippers think everything's
a mother-flipping joke.

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,566
Well, let me tell you
the chokey ain't no jokey, sucker.

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,049
Look at me and what do you see?

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,606
Just a badass brother
who made a mistake.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,768
One mistake!

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,529
And now I'm staring at you gimps
every flipping day.

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,044
So what's my story?

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,448
How did a brother get here?

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,649
Well, I'll tell you.

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,921
It all started when I went
to fix a printer on floor seven.

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,247
As I recall, it was a Tuesday.

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,369
It's a... It's a lot faster now.

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,888
That's one of the advantages
of the Pentium processor.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,081
Yeah.

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,605
I like your glasses.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,007
I'm afraid they're not for sale.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,724
Ha ha.

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,571
Laugh all you want,
they're not for sale.

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,651
You're funny.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,486
Nikki! Nikki! Nikki!

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,610
What are you talking to
Clive Sinclair for?

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,091
Shut up, Rog.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,168
Good one. Yeah, I get it.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,326
You obviously don't, mate.
Come on! Back in your box.

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,088
Nice tie, by the way!

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,646
Thank you.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,885
Roy, can you come here, please?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,970
Uh, just hold on a second, Jen.
I'm giving phone support.

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,367
Okay, so how did that go? Well...

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,926
Yeah, but that's a important part
of the process.

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,162
Yes, if you don't complete that part,

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,886
there's no way that you're going
to be able to do the next bit.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,083
Okay, so now...turn it back on again!

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,484
People...

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,648
That is rude! What is that?

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,331
Oh! Jen, I have to say "Have you tried
turning it off and on again?"

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,250
about a thousand times a day.
It's like a bloody catchphrase.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,921
If it wasn't for you and Moss,
it would be the only thing I say.

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,647
It doesn't matter. Don't take your
bad career decisions out on the users.

51
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,966
I'm not saying it again today.

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,730
You know, they can just figure it out
for themselves.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,525
You'll never go a whole day
without saying it.

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,529
- You don't think I can?
- No way.

55
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,404
I bet you a thousand pounds I can.

56
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,723
Oh! Uh-uh, that's just posturing,
a thousand pounds.

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,605
All right, okay. Hundred pounds
says I don't say it again today.

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,610
- How's that for posturing?
- All right, you're on.

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,131
- Hundred quid.
- All right.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,242
Can you come here for a sec, please?

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,011
- Why?
- I want you to take a look at something.

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,770
Can't I do it on the phone?

63
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,167
Just come in! It's like 20 feet!

64
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,961
You all right, Moss?

65
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,286
I don't mind telling you, Roy,

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,643
that sometimes the people upstairs
cheese me off to such an extent

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,922
that if I were the type
to use bad language,

68
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,407
I'd be employing it
bitterly and repeatedly.

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,000
Whoa. Whoa, Moss, that's not like you.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,289
Well, I'm sorry for mentioning
bad language.

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,244
No, use bad language, Moss, please!
It'll make you feel better.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,724
Ffff...

73
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,120
Ploppers!

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,251
Someone told me I need a browser
on my computer.

75
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,691
-- Could you install one, please?

76
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,326
You don't have a browser
on your compu...

77
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,841
What is... What is that sound?
Is that coming from your laptop?

78
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,726
It's not supposed to sound... What the!
What's all that crap?

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,644
How long has that been... I haven't
seen that one since the '90s!

80
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,921
Oh, Jen, I have to fix this.

81
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,281
No, no, leave it.
I have it how I like it.

82
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,722
How you like it?
No, no, no, Jen, it's infected!

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,969
If this was a human being,
I'd shoot it in the face.

84
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,126
I just want you to install a browser.

85
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,605
That's the browser there!

86
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,849
Look at it! That's the browser.
Internet Explorer is a browser.

87
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,770
Behind the picture of the lady.
The lady's not supposed to be there!

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,044
Oh, hey, she's only there sometimes.
But what... What about the "e"?

89
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,844
But that's the button
for the internet, Roy.

90
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,645
- I don't...
-"The button for the internet"?

91
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,761
Jesus Christ!

92
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,123
Oh, shut up.
I'm not a stupid geeky-geek.

93
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,924
Jen, you don't need
to be a geek

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,202
to know that you need a browser
to access the internet.

95
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,005
Yes, you do, because as soon
as you know something like that,

96
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,929
it pushes out something important

97
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,805
and before you know it, you're painting
little figurines from Lord of the Rings.

98
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Oh!

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,121
You know what, Jen?
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

100
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,891
You want to walk around with the laptop
from The Exorcist, that's just fine.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,970
It's not my problem.
Our time is too valuable.

102
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,569
Come on, Moss, let's go.
It's nearly one.

103
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,923
Oh, don't forget, they're giving
a party for Ben Genderson at lunch.

104
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,486
Ben Genderson? Oh, how nice for him.

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,001
He's been here, what? A week?
When's our party?

106
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,451
I thought you hated parties.

107
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,166
I like parties.
It's balloons I don't like.

108
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,521
- Right.
- You don't like balloons?

109
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,324
Oh, don't talk to me about balloons.

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,568
- Why?
- Balloons explode, Jen.

111
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,247
They explode, suddenly and unexpectedly.

112
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,409
They are filled with the capacity
to give me a little fright

113
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,602
and I find that unbearable.

114
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,600
Where do you want to go for lunch?

115
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,882
It's such a lovely day.
Shall we go to the park?

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,571
Yeah, let's have a lovely lunch
in the park.

117
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,609
Roy, do you think if I hadn't paid
so much attention in school,

118
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,643
I'd be a different person?

119
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,761
No.

120
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,927
We're going to be late
for Ben Genderson's party.

121
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,486
So? I don't want to go to that thing.
If we go to that party,

122
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,409
do you know how many times
I'm going to have to say "Have you..."

123
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,760
The thing that I say.

124
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,087
Yeah, but we've got to hurry up.
We're going to be in trouble.

125
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,965
- I'm not running.
- Can you do a fast walk?

126
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,447
- No.
- I'm going to do a fast walk.

127
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,405
See you there.

128
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,400
I need to be at work.

129
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,490
Sorry, sir. Whole street's closed.
Suspicious package.

130
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,569
Come on, let's go the long way round.

131
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,569
We're going to miss the presentation.
We're already late.

132
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,170
- We're going to get in trouble.
- Calm down.

133
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,170
I can't, Roy.
What are we going to do?

134
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,569
- Moss, it doesn't matter.
- We're going to get in trouble.

135
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,091
You're not going to
get in trouble, Moss.

136
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,611
Getting in trouble is something
that happens to children.

137
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,166
- You're a grown man.

138
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,884
Hey, come here...

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,880
Why don't we bunk off?

140
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,086
What?

141
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,450
I was hoping to avoid Jen today, anyway.
Why don't we just... We'll bunk off,

142
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,324
we'll make a day of it,
it'll be a laugh.

143
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,489
Oh, my gosh! I've got to take this in.
I've never bunked off in my life.

144
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,171
What... What... I mean, what will we do?
Where will we go?

145
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,163
You know,
we'll do bunking off kind of things.

146
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,044
Should we really be talking
this close to the police?

147
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,321
I mean, it is illegal, right?

148
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,841
Not unless you're supposed to be
in school. Will you relax?

149
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,566
I'm excited, Roy. This is like
taking the blue pill in The Matrix.

150
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,411
I mean, bunking off,
the old me would never have done that.

151
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,410
Say goodbye to that guy.
That guy's history. Bang! He's gone.

152
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,807
Could you not say "bang"?
There's a bloody bomb somewhere.

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,571
Come on, let's just... Let's just go.

154
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,731
Would you stop looking so suspicious?

155
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,208
Which is why, after one week with us,
we honour Ben Genderson.

156
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,051
-- Okay, okay.

157
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,609
Come on, Ben, say a few words.

158
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,690
Well, I don't know what to, uh...

159
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,847
Such... Such a lovely thing to happen.

160
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,688
I never thought that a major corporation
would be able to focus on

161
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,643
one individual like this.

162
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,491
At my last company,
I felt rather insignificant.

163
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,650
So, it's, uh,
it's appreciated. It really is. Cheers.

164
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,402
Don't raise your glass too soon, Ben,
'cause this has all been one big ruse.

165
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,488
It isn't your day at all.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,004
That's right. I thought it high time
that we give the IT department

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,168
the attention they deserve.

168
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,125
Where are Mark and Ray?

169
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,961
Oh! Um...
They're not back from lunch yet.

170
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,370
Really? I flew George Lucas in
to see them, as a treat.

171
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,961
Oh, well, Jen, more champagne for us.
Let the revels begin!

172
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,805
Yeah!

173
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,970
Yeah.

174
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,804
Oh, yes.

175
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,364
Sitting on the bus.

176
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,804
On the open road.

177
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,451
Kicking back.

178
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,371
Just a pair of cheeky bunkers.

179
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,807
- Couple of ne'er-do-wells.
- Yeah.

180
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,210
Roy, can I clarify something?
Are we now loitering?

181
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,763
Um, yeah.

182
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,884
'Cause it feels like travelling.

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,447
Sure, but we don't actually
want to go where this bus is going.

184
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,404
- So, there's an element of loitering.
- There's an aimlessness.

185
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,806
- Exactly.
- Yeah!

186
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,049
Who'd want to end up going
to where they wanted to be?

187
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,605
That's what the Man wants.

188
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,881
So true.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,809
- Fools.

190
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,161
Roy. Roy, let's glare.

191
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,684
- What?
- Let's glare at people.

192
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,881
Like a couple of tough nuts.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,243
Oh! OK. Who?

194
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,570
Let's glare at this sucker
on his way to work.

195
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,365
Yeah, feeding the corporate machine.

196
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,925
And, uh...

197
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,091
- He's coming up.
- He's getting on the bus.

198
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,486
Oh, no.

199
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,204
Why did you suggest him?
You could've suggested anybody.

200
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,246
What are you looking at?

201
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,721
We weren't.
We thought you were someone else.

202
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,444
What's it to you?

203
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,763
Don't listen to him.
We're bunking off and he's excited.

204
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,530
We're bunking off!

205
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,850
Roy has a fear of balloons.

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,206
A fear of balloons.

207
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,449
That's the craziest thing
I've ever bloody heard.

208
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,001
- Here's your wine.
- Oh, sorry, I asked for red.

209
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,406
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no, no, leave it.

210
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,365
This has been a success.

211
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,131
I have had a lovely, lovely time.

212
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,448
As thingy was saying earlier,

213
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,404
it's easy to go unrecognised
in a big corporation,

214
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,683
so it's appreciated.
It really is. Cheers.

215
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,724
Don't raise your glasses
too soon,

216
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,764
because this ruse has also been a ruse.

217
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,285
Ladies and gentleman,
let me introduce to you

218
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,371
our new head of hiring and firing,
Ben Genderson.

219
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,442
So, Ben, you've been circulating
throughout this fake party,

220
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,042
coming to conclusions.
Who's the obvious dead wood?

221
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,167
Well, yes. Well, it's Paul over there.

222
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,090
He's been putting his shopping
on expenses.

223
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,408
James here, he can't spell.

224
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,000
And, uh... Sorry, what's your name?

225
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,771
- Jeremy.
- Jeremy, yes. Jeremy's a drunk.

226
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,723
And Jen, uh, Jen lacks
basic computer skills.

227
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,648
Like thinking that IT stands for
Internet Things.

228
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't really need
to know about those things.

229
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,449
I'm a relationship manager.

230
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,608
I manage my team. I'm a team leader.

231
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,722
And where's your team now?

232
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,961
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

233
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,208
Uh, is this my party or not?

234
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,851
- What are we doing?
- We are loitering.

235
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,450
We are shopping.

236
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,129
We don't have any money,
so it's definitely loitering.

237
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,767
Mark my words, in half an hour,
we shall be asked to leave.

238
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,565
Um...

239
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,682
- Oh, it's Jen. Yeah?
- Hello, Jen!

240
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,530
Where are you?

241
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,005
Uh, we're just, um,

242
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,646
we're just sort of taking a long lunch
sort of thing.

243
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,091
You can't take a long lunch
sort of thing.

244
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,850
I've been sent an e-mail
questionnaire thing

245
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,961
and I have to do it today.

246
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,206
I don't know what
you're talking about, Jen.

247
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,766
It wasn't Ben Genderson's thing,
it was our thing.

248
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,211
And then it was some scary thing.

249
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,209
And now Ben Genderson's sent me
a bloody e-mail questionnaire

250
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,800
about my job and my computer won't work!
What do I do?

251
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,242
Is that the best you can do?
I'm not going to say it.

252
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,211
No! No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

253
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,688
God damn it, Roy! I didn't bunk off
so I could do some flipping perusing.

254
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,084
I want to taste the apple, Roy.
I want to bite the electric tiger's tail

255
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,166
and ride it till the end of the
mother-flipping line.

256
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,205
- Will you just calm down, Moss?

257
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,361
Oh...

258
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,206
- What are you doing?
- I'm shoplifting.

259
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,483
- You've just gone insane.
- I've never felt so alive.

260
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,887
You need to give this stuff back.

261
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,041
Okay, they're onto us. Let's just go.
And act normal.

262
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,925
What is wrong with you? Who are you?

263
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,804
I don't know any more.

264
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,924
What are we gonna do?

265
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,682
No! That's not going to work!

266
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,051
Okay, run! Run, run, run, run, run...

267
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,724
Come on! Come on!

268
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,484
Mmm... Mmm...

269
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,566
...Two two.

270
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,525
Hello.
Do you wish for technical assistance?

271
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,563
Oh, God, I hate these.

272
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,842
Sorry?

273
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,688
- What?
- How dare you

274
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,689
speak to me like that?

275
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,167
Sorry. Um, can I have
technical assistance, please?

276
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,763
Putting you through. Cow

277
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,847
- Hello.
- Hello.

278
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,486
Hello, how can I be of assistance?

279
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,129
- What?
- How can I be of assistance?

280
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,129
Um, I've got one of your laptops.
It won't get past the loading screen.

281
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,720
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

282
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,366
Yes, look,
is there someone else I can talk to?

283
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,164
There is no one else available.

284
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,523
- All right, all right.
- Which model do you have?

285
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,286
What model do I have?

286
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,880
- Yes.
- It's a Zubion, I think.

287
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,681
Oh, Zubion is...

288
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,043
Can you press the...

289
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,286
I didn't get that.

290
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,882
Can you press...

291
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,687
No, that was worse, somehow.

292
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,890
Uh, can...

293
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,601
- Can?
- Yes.

294
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,210
Can you press...

295
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,209
- Can you press?
- Delete.

296
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,760
Delete. Can I press Delete?

297
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,444
Yeah. "Wheel"...

298
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,250
"Wheel..."

299
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,330
"Wheel." Eh, during.

300
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,768
- While, while!
- Yes, "wheel".

301
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,524
- Yes.
-"...shtotting... "

302
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,207
Hello?

303
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,526
All right, come on! We're nearly there.

304
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,687
Oh...

305
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,130
It's no use... I can't...
Okay, we're going down again.

306
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,481
-- How many times is that now?

307
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,129
Oh, this is ridiculous!
I don't want to do this any more!

308
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,801
All right... All right...

309
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,961
- What was all that about?
- What?

310
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,845
You shouldn't be messing around
on those things.

311
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,086
Go on.

312
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,409
Don't come back here.
I know your faces now!

313
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,321
Bunking off was a terrible idea.

314
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,726
I mean, you were completely
out of control.

315
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,922
I mean, do you even like Grand Designs?

316
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,121
Yeah.

317
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,086
You will send those DVDs
back to the shop.

318
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,326
Okay. I'm sorry, Roy.

319
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,329
It's okay. Yeah, let's just try
and get back into work

320
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,204
and hopefully nobody
will have noticed we were away.

321
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,966
Oh my gosh!

322
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,330
It's a robot!

323
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,009
I've never seen one in the wild before.

324
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,044
Where'd you come from, fella? Huh?
Where'd you come from?

325
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,403
Can we keep him, Roy?
I mean, if he doesn't belong to anyone.

326
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,524
I just don't understand what it's doing?
I mean, this is weird.

327
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,971
What is it?

328
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,680
- Uh, Moss?

329
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,881
What?

330
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,487
- Get away from it.
- Why?

331
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,971
Hello, Jen!

332
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,724
It's a robot!

333
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,606
Get away!

334
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,370
- What?
- Get away!

335
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,967
Get away from it! There's a bomb!

336
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,609
What are you saying?

337
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,167
There's a bomb in the bag!

338
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,289
I think this might be
a bomb-disposal robot, Roy.

339
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,721
I know.

340
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,568
We should move away from it.

341
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,250
Yes, we should.

342
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,247
But I don't seem to be able to move.

343
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,283
- What?
- I can't move.

344
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,523
- What do you mean you can't move?
- I can't move.

345
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,810
- You have to move, Roy.
- I can't move.

346
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,806
I'm just having a couple
of problems with it.

347
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,241
What kind of operating system
does it use?

348
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,850
It's, uh..Vista.

349
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,366
We're going to die!

350
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,368
Did you try turning it
off and on again?

351
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,561
What?

352
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,451
Did you try turning it
off and on again?

353
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,641
What?

354
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,128
Have you tried turning it
off and on again?

355
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,324
I just won a hundred quid.

356
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,682
Okay. Hang on a second!

357
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,007
Why are you still here?
Why haven't you run away?

358
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,724
Oh, come on, Roy. We're a team.

359
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,922
I could nev... Oh, wait, I could
totally run away, couldn't I?

360
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,001
It's still not working!

361
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,724
Oh! This is a very common problem
with Vista.

362
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,606
I can fix this. I can fix this, Roy!

363
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,609
Everything's going to be okay!

364
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,165
Hooray!

365
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,728
Right. Come here, you.

366
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,166
Aww.

367
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,202
Hooray!

368
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,606
Aww.

369
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,930
Wait for me!

370
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,246
Is there a customer support number?

371
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,041
Uh...

372
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,246
Hello, can I be of assistance?

373
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,641
What?

374
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,530
So, that's my story.

375
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,962
It ain't a pretty story,
but it's the only one I got.

376
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,050
And if you bozos don't buckle up
and fly right,

377
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,601
it'll be your story, too. Capiche?

378
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,767
What?
