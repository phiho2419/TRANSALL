1
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,361
Hope this doesn't embarrass you, Jen, but I
find the best thing to do with a new employee

2
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,848
is to size them up
with a long, hard stare.

3
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,730
- So.
- So.

4
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,001
- First day.
- Yes.

5
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,451
- Scary.
- Yes.

6
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,688
- Don't be scared.
- I'm not really scared.

7
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,564
- You should be.
- I am a little bit scared.

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,569
- Well, don't be.
- Make up your mind.

9
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,286
Ha, ha, ha! So here you are.

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,802
Yes. Really looking forward
to getting to grips...

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,649
I'm going to put you in IT,

12
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,971
because you said in your cv you have
a lot of experience with computers.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,401
I did say that on my cv, yes.

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,321
I have a lot of experience
with the whole computer thing.

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,204
You know, emails.

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,561
Sending emails.
Receiving emails.

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,206
Deleting emails. Um...

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,084
I could go on.

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,770
Do.

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,045
The web. Using mouse... mices.
Using mice. Um...

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,970
Clicking, double clicking. Um...

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,890
The computer screen, of course.
The keyboard.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,924
- The bit that goes on the floor down there.
- The hard drive?

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,644
- Correct.
- Uh-huh.

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,888
Well, you certainly seem
to know your stuff.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,846
Settled. Got a good feeling about you, Jen.
And they need a new manager.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,282
Fantastic. So the people
I'll be working with, what are they like?

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,368
Standard nerds!

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,964
Hello, IT.

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,562
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,402
Ugh! OK, well, the button on the side,
is it glowing?

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,121
Yeah, you need to turn it on.

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,841
The button turns it on.

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,206
Yeah, you...

35
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,005
You do know how a button works, don't you?

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,727
- No, not on clothes.
- Hello, IT.

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,047
Yeah-ha.

38
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,369
Have you tried
forcing an unexpected reboot?

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,689
No, there you go. No, there you go.
I just heard it come on.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,802
No, no, that's the music you hear
when it comes on.

41
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,888
No, that's the music you hear when...

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,890
I'm sorry, are you from the past?

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,049
See, the driver hooks the function
by patching the system call table,

44
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,085
so it's not safe to unload it unless another
thread's about to jump in and do its stuff,

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,001
and you don't want to end up
in the middle of invalid memory.

46
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,649
Hello?

47
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,082
Oh, really? Really? Well, why don't you
come down here and make me, then?

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,965
What? You think I'm afraid of you?
I'm not afraid of you.

49
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,926
You can come down here any time
and I'll be waiting for you.

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,168
That told her.

51
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,090
Oh, God, it's about time you got back.
It's been all go.

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,931
- You had a job?
- Girl on fifth.

53
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,964
Did you and her hit it off?

54
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,651
Define '*hit it off'*.

55
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,163
Did she continue talking to you
once you'd fixed her computer?

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,009
No.

57
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,488
And while I was working on it,
she rested a cup on my back.

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,331
- No.
- Yep.

59
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,044
Unbelievable.

60
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,563
They've no respect for us up there. No respect
whatsoever. We're all just drudgeons to them.

61
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,844
Yes. If there were such a thing as a
drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them.

62
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,806
They're pally-wally when there's a problem
with their printer, but once it's fixed...

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,321
They toss us away like yesterday's jam.

64
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes! Yesterday's jam.
That is what we are to them.

65
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,650
Actually, you know what?
That doesn't really work as a thing.

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,001
Because jam lasts for ages.

67
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,210
Hello, IT.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

68
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,086
Unisex toilets.
You have unisex toilets.

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,362
Like <i>Ally McBeal.</i>

70
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,168
That's the sort of place this is, Jen.

71
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,444
A lot of sexy people not doing much work
and having affairs.

72
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,483
Wow.

73
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,604
Oh, my God. Look at that view.

74
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,724
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

75
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,888
Well, Jen, this is where I leave you.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,923
<i>Floor34.</i>

77
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,210
Very exciting.
OK. Where am I going?

78
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,450
All the way down to the basement.
Good luck.

79
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,207
<i>Get out of the lift.
Get out of the lift.</i>

80
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,688
<i>Get out of the lift.
Get out of the lift.</i>

81
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,242
<i>Get out of the lift.
Get out of the lift.</i>

82
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,882
<i>Get out of the lift.
Get out of the lift.</i>

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,968
<i>Get out of the lift.</i>

84
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,604
- Oh, won't be a tick.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

85
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,688
Oh, God. OK.

86
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,723
Argh!

87
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,368
Hello.

88
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,688
Hello.

89
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,606
Yes, I believe it was Tolstoy
who said... Oh, it seems we have a visitor.

90
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,806
I'm sorry, myself and Maurice were engaged in
a serious discussion about books and such.

91
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,922
We didn't hear you come in.

92
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,361
Wait a second.
You said it was Tolstoy who said what?

93
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,485
- Oh, never mind that now, Maurice.
- When have you read Tolstoy?

94
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,161
- Shut up, Maurice.
- Why are you speaking in that weird voice?

95
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,808
When did...?
I don't remember this conversation at all.

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,080
Don't let me disturb you.
I just wanted to come down...

97
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,482
Oh, don't be silly, you never disturbed us.

98
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,049
Oh.

99
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,401
Many people come down here to visit.

100
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,162
What are you talking about?
Who comes down? What people?

101
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,886
Why are you giving me
the secret signal to shut up?

102
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,045
So... Um...

103
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,322
What can we do you for?

104
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,524
I'm the new head of this department.

105
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,928
Is this my office?

106
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,563
Why...? What did she...?

107
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,365
Did she just say what...?
I am the head of this department.

108
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,608
I thought I was.

109
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,008
Well, it's one of us. It's certainly
not her. I'm going to sort this out.

110
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,851
Roy, you've got a head wound there.
Head wound!

111
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,131
Hi. I don't want to be rude or anything,

112
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,403
but I wasn't informed
of any changes to this department.

113
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,568
Oh, did they not tell you about me?

114
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,890
No. And we are perfectly fine down here,
thank you very much.

115
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,287
We're more than capable
of taking care of ourselves.

116
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,483
Sure, sure.
You know you're covered in blood?

117
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,690
Moss. Amazon thingy.

118
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,691
Ah, wicked. I know what this is.
It's the new Harry Potter.

119
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,724
I got the child edition
and the adult edition,

120
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,607
just to check
that there are no differences in the text.

121
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,570
I'm sorry, but I'm not going
to be able to deal with that woman.

122
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,080
Is nobody else going to get the phone?
I suppose I'll get it.

123
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,364
No, that is not a phone.
I'm going to have a little lie down.

124
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,442
Come in.

125
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,847
Yeah, Denholm. Yeah, yeah.

126
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,968
No, no, no, no, no.
No, they've been fine so far.

127
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,845
Yeah. I think we're going to get on great.

128
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,444
Yeah, I know.
All right, then. No, you take care.

129
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,450
All right. Yeah, I will, yeah.

130
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,643
OK, OK, take care. Take care.

131
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,728
OK, bye. Bye.

132
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,808
So, hello. What can I do you fo...
What can I do for you?

133
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,926
Hello. I was just wondering,
do you want me to connect up your phone?

134
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,286
No, n-n-n-n-n-no, no, no.
It's working.

135
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,085
I was just talking to Denholm there.

136
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,646
- But how?
- Would you mind...?

137
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,491
Would you mind closing the door for me?

138
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,568
Oh, yeah. Sure.

139
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,602
Yeah, from the other side.

140
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,528
Of course.

141
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,003
- Like this?
- That's it.

142
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,802
- With me on the...
- Thanks.

143
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,648
Oh.

144
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,561
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes, Moss, I'm fine.

145
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,331
The nurse said
I didn't do myself any serious damage.

146
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,046
- I'm standing over here.
- I know, I know. I'm joking.

147
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,401
I'm fine.
What are we going to do about her?

148
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,366
Well, I just went in
and she was having a pretend conversation.

149
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,766
- Really?
- Yes.

150
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,202
She's a little bit weird,
to say the least.

151
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,404
- What's that?
- Oh, just water.

152
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,320
Sometimes I get a hot ear,
and this helps cool it down.

153
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,046
She is quite the oddball.

154
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,370
Did you notice how she didn't even
get excited when saw this original ZX81?

155
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,565
Yeah, that was weird. It's almost as if
she doesn't know anything about computers.

156
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,401
- What?
- What are you doing?

157
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,808
Don't worry.
That's why I always make two cups of tea.

158
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,649
Anyway, what were we talking about?

159
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,651
- Her not knowing anything about computers.
- What?

160
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,121
OK, so we definitely
want to get rid of her.

161
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,369
- Agreed. Yeah.
- OK, so here's the plan.

162
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,769
A plan.
Let me put on my slightly larger glasses.

163
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,770
- OK, hit me.
- OK, we go in.

164
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,202
- When?
- You know, like, in a minute.

165
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,802
Will that be enough time
for me to get to know the plan?

166
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,526
Yeah, you know what?
I shouldn't have used the word "plan".

167
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,281
- I've clearly gotten you overexcited.
- Would scheme be a better word?

168
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,361
Although, that's just as exciting.
I might even need these.

169
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,810
All I was going to say was, we go in, I
make up a load of bollocks about computers,

170
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,890
and we'll see if she picks up on it.

171
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,531
Yes. I can see why
you didn't want to use the word "plan".

172
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,007
- Let me do the talking.
- All right.

173
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,326
Ooh, Moss, Moss.

174
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,171
OK, we need to get this right, yeah?

175
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,241
We need to stay calm.
We do not want to go in there half-cocked.

176
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,080
OK.

177
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,969
Hang on, guys.

178
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,161
How can I help?

179
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,045
Well, we were just wondering,
now that you're "the boss",

180
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,645
would you like us to access the data
supplier and connect you up to the matrix?

181
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,286
You just made all that up.

182
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,760
You don't know anything
about computers, admit it!

183
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,804
Will you stop trying to undermine me?

184
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,811
Now get in there and do some work
to do with com-puters.

185
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,606
I'll be in there in a minute
to check up on you.

186
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,724
OK, lady, you've won this round.

187
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,123
But we can wait.

188
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,881
You <i>will slip</i> up one day and, believe
you me, we will be there when you do.

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,490
There will be some piece of evidence

190
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,127
that will prove without any doubt that
you don't know anything about computers.

191
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,242
What are you doing?

192
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,567
Plugging in your computer.

193
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,880
It might be something you say,
or something you do,

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,322
but when we notice it,
and, believe me, we will notice it,

195
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,809
it's going to be
a long way down for you, sweet cheeks.

196
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,566
He'll realise in a second.

197
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,324
Ha!

198
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,370
I cannot believe you're
going to tell on me.

199
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,201
You're like a pair of horrible old women.

200
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,368
What did she say?

201
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,007
- She said we're like horrible old women.
- She didn't?

202
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,805
Hey, guys.
I hear you've got something to tell me.

203
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,925
- Yes, well, it's like this.
- Look at you. My IT team.

204
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,247
- Yeah.
- Team players, each and every one of you.

205
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,282
Yeah, well, she...

206
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,290
There's no room for people
who can't act in a team on my team.

207
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,051
Excuse me. Hello.

208
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,491
What?

209
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,444
Well, if you can't work as a team,
you're all fired.

210
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,281
That's it. You heard me. Fired.
Get your things and go.

211
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,768
Hello, Security.
Everyone on floor four is fired.

212
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,201
Escort them from the premises.
And do it as a team.

213
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,689
Remember, you're a team and if you
can't act as a team, you're fired too.

214
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,643
Dawn, get on to Recruitment.

215
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,650
Get them to look for a security team
that can work as a team.

216
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,688
They may have to escort the current team from
the building for not acting like a team.

217
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,725
Team. Team, team, team, team, team.

218
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,764
I even love saying the word "team".

219
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,441
You probably think
that's a picture of my family. Uh-uh.

220
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,086
It's the A-Team.

221
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,409
Bodie, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man.

222
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,126
The whole lot of them.

223
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,406
- So what do you want to tell me?
- Well, it's just not working out.

224
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,045
- He's joking.
- But you said...

225
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,050
- Not working out?
- Oh, no.

226
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,050
We are getting on like a big house on fire.

227
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,128
My ear's getting hot.

228
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,602
No. You know what?
We should leave now,

229
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,520
because you're a busy man and we've
taken up far too much of your time.

230
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,610
- Jen, could you get the door for me there?
- Absolutely, Roy.

231
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,805
- Why did you come here in the first place?
- Um...

232
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,211
We set up a voice-activation system on your
computer. I think you're going to enjoy it.

233
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,325
It might take a little while to get the pitch
right on the voice, but nonetheless, go ahead.

234
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,647
- Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

235
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,364
How exciting.

236
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,568
Hello.

237
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,405
Hello, computer.

238
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,690
Hello.

239
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,763
Hello.

240
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,564
Hello, computer.

241
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,804
I mean, what good are you? You obviously
don't know anything about computers.

242
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,163
No. But, OK,
but I can learn, you know.

243
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,729
I mean, for example - Moss, you could take
me through what you're doing right now.

244
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,402
I'd be delighted. I'm just working
on a very simple piece of programming code.

245
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,041
I see.

246
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,891
Oh, God, no, I'm lying again.
I didn't understand any of that.

247
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,766
I don't know anything about computers.
I mean, I'm absolutely useless to you.

248
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,406
I might as well pack up and go home.

249
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,048
Hi. Is Roy around?

250
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,882
Hello, there, little lady.
Are you lost? How can I help you? I'm Roy.

251
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,125
Oh!

252
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,720
You wanted me to come down? Huh?

253
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,242
- Well, here I am.
- Not the face!

254
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,169
Not the face!

255
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,810
Well, maybe this will teach you to treat
people with a little bit of respect!

256
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,050
Is there any chance
we spoke on the phone earlier?

257
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,049
Oh, my God. Are those Manolos?

258
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,607
- Oh, yes.
- They are gorgeous. Were they expensive?

259
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,007
No. No, no, no.
Got them in the sale.

260
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,203
Oh, God. Clever you. I'm never
lucky enough to get a bargain like that.

261
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,005
- Well, I should take you shopping.
- That would be fantastic.

262
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,770
- I'm upstairs.
- I'll give you a call.

263
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,089
- Nice to meet you. Take care.
- Nice meeting you.

264
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,444
Chairman Wow.
You just defused that entire situation.

265
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,244
What situation?

266
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,921
Oh, that. Yeah.
Oh, my God. Does that happen a lot?

267
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,283
They're fairly regular, the beatings, yes.

268
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,687
I'd say we're on a biweekly beating.

269
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,167
Oh, it's not all that bad.

270
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,806
Come on, Roy. It's pretty bad.

271
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,209
Maybe I could help with this.
You know, I mean, I'm a people person,

272
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,803
and people like you need a person to deal
with people - a people person like me.

273
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,886
Oh, my God. Ideas are coming.
Things are happening here.

274
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,162
OK, OK. What would you say, yeah,

275
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,571
if I told you that I had a plan
to raise your profile upstairs by 100%?

276
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,490
- What would you say?
- It can't be done. You're crazy.

277
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,002
What would you say, Roy?
Roy's passed out. OK.

278
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,806
I need a felt-tip pen and some paper.

279
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,208
Yeah. Yeah. No, no.

280
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,050
No, really, really, really.
It was a true story.

281
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,844
Unbelievable.

282
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,931
I don't know why we don't go out with you
IT guys more often. You're hilarious.

283
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,008
Yes, we are!

284
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,488
Well, you guys should
come down here more often, you know.

285
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,524
You should see this
as a new era for Reynholm Industries.

286
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,723
"A new era
for Reynholm Industries."

287
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,526
Oh, God. You know what? If you wanna hear
something really funny, a really funny story,

288
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,042
you should hear what happened to Moss and I
when we were so drunk in Amsterdam

289
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,686
that Moss lost his glasses.

290
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,928
Moss! Moss!

291
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,601
Come here, come here. Tell them that story
about when we were drunk in Amsterdam.

292
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,041
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, it's brilliant.

293
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,803
This is a great story. You're going to love it.
I'm just going to get another box of wine.

294
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,888
Well, go on, then.

295
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,042
All right.

296
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,404
- Well, one night we were really drunk.
- Yeah.

297
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,605
And we were so drunk
that we decided to hire prostitutes.

298
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,400
When they arrived at the hotel,
we were too scared to do anything,

299
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,920
so we brought them to a fair.

300
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,850
They were really nice.
In the end, they only charged us half.

301
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,123
But we did have to pay for all the rides.

302
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,491
Ha, ha!

303
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,524
Oh, isn't that just the best story?

304
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,130
Oh, man.

305
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,447
You told me
to never tell that story to anyone.

306
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,642
What are you talking about?
It's a brilliant story.

307
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,162
And then you nearly walked into the canal.
Has he got to that part with the boatman?

308
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,248
Oh.

309
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,407
You mean the story
where I lost my glasses?

310
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,848
Yes.

311
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,449
What story did you think I meant?

312
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,130
Moss?

313
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,130
What did you say?
What did you say?

314
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,080
It's all right for you two.

315
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,443
You're used to being social piranhas.

316
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,170
I'm a very popular person usually.

317
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,207
That girl earlier, that tried to
beat me to death with her shoes,

318
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,243
did anybody get her number?

319
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,808
That was a nice day at the fair, wasn't it?

320
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,727
With Brandy and Crystal.

321
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,768
Hello, IT.

322
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,406
Yeah. Have you tried
turning it off and on again?

323
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,325
Hello!

324
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,005
Hello!

325
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,685
Hello!

326
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,046
Hello!

327
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,084
