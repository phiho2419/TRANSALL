1
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,489
Wow! That's quite something.
Quite an honour.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,001
- I know.
- They must be very impressed with you.

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,283
I didn't even know they had
an Employee of the Month thing here.

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,882
- Really? I thought you won it once.
- No, everyone thought I was dead.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,240
Aha.

6
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,523
Employee... of the Month.

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,962
Yeah, it's a valued title.

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,289
- Have you ever won it?
- Er, no. No, I haven't.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,883
I don't know, Jen, sometimes I think
it's because I just want it so damn much!

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,728
I am the Employee of the Month.

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,243
And yet, to a casual observer, it would appear
that you do very little around here.

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,330
Yeah. They must have seen through that.

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,889
I think someone up there
must have sensed something in me,

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,927
something I've always known was there -
a greatness?

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,250
No, I'm not saying that,
but... well, something.

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,204
Yeah! Yeah, I'm sensing something.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,891
Don't worry,
I won't let it go to my head.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,048
Guess who's won
Employee of the Month.

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,401
- Roy.
- No.

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,851
- Richmond.
- No.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,371
- Harry.
- Who's Harry?

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,244
- The postman.
- No.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,044
- Me.
- No.

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,606
- I said Roy, right? Richmond.
- Meeeee!

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,121
- Oh! Oh, about time!
- Yeah.

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,730
- Whatever happened to Richmond?
- He got scurvy.

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,961
Be more specific. I'm trying to build up
a picture of your role in Reynholm Industries.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,005
Well, I'm the boss,
head honcho, el numero uno,

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,441
Mr Big, the Godfather,

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,642
Lord of the Rings,

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,728
the Bourne Identity,

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,684
er... Taxi Driver,

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,564
Jaws.

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,843
I forgot the question quite a while back.
Who are you again?

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,851
I'm April Shepherd. You're being made
Richest magazine's Man of the Year.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,361
- I'm doing the profile.
- Oh, yes, that's right.

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,962
- You're the boss - what does that entail?
- Oh, many things.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,722
This morning, for instance, I had to choose
the Employee of the Month from the box.

39
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,727
May I ask,
what are you doing on that pad?

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,845
One of my little hobbies is
 caricature.

41
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,442
Sometimes I like to sketch someone
as I'm talking to them.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,881
- May I?
- Well, I'm not very good.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,651
I'm no Truman Capote.

44
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,447
Great. OK, erm... I'll tell you what,
let's just do some quickfire questions.

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,450
Maybe they'll give me an insight
into "the real you".

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,561
OK.

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,480
- Who is your favourite person from history?
- Sherlock Holmes.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,966
- Well, he's fictional.
- Whoa!

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,368
I think you'd better
check your facts there. Fictional?

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,246
Who took care of the business
with the giant dog that was eating everybody?

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,850
It wasn't Watson.

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,804
Don't tell me,
I suppose he was fictional too?

53
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,922
Maybe there was no giant dog.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,561
No, no, I think you're playing games
with me, young lady!

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,208
- OK, then, favourite fictional character?
- Oh...  the Elephant Man.

56
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,767
Tell you what, let me widen the question out.
Favourite popular figure?

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,770
- Churchill.
- What is it you like about him?

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,882
I love the way he says:

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,368
"Oh, yes! Oh, yes!"

60
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,407
I think perhaps it's you
who's playing games with me.

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,570
- You're a very surprising man, Mr Reynholm.
- Yes...

62
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,682
I am a surprising man.

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,479


64
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,131
April, may I take you to dinner?

65
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,764
- Oh, I don't think I could possibly...
- In Paris.

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,728
- Paris?!
- Paris, yes.

67
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,808
It's the name of a new restaurant in Hull.

68
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,241
That's right, we're going to Hull!

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,244
Hey, Roy, come over here.
Look at this.

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,968
"'The biggest adventure you can
ever take is to live the life of your dreams' -

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,242
Oprah Winfrey"?!

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,204
I suppose that is the biggest adventure.

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,607
Guys, come on in.

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,404
Sit down.

75
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,488
- Is this a new desk?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,083
I thought I needed some new furniture,
so I got some stuff from upstairs. Sit down.

77
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,487
I just thought, what with
all this extra attention on us... on me,

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,290
it might be worth looking at ourselves
and saying, "Hey, am I really giving it 110%?"

79
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,928
"And if not, why not? What the heck is wrong
with me? Am I mentally ill or something?"

80
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,646
Roy, let's start with you.

81
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,525
When you're upstairs,
fiddling about with compu-ters,

82
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,564
would it hurt to smile?

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,207
Don't you realise
what a difference that would make? Eh?

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,085
Come on, let's see a smile now.
Come on.

85
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,328
No, more warmth. Warmer.

86
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,764
You're just showing more teeth.
That's not warmth.

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,850
I would say that's
more of a threatening look, actually.

88
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,726
I'll tell you what, Roy, keep at it.
That's your homework. Moss...

89
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,447
- So, what's your speech going to be about?
- What speech?

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,610
Every Employee of the Month has to
give a speech in their area of expertise.

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,291
Which for you is "compu-ters".

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,091
- Where do I have to...?
- At the monthly shareholders' meeting.

93
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,128
- When do I have to...?
- Friday.

94
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,409
- What time...?
- Morning.

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,850
How's that?

96
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,522
- What's up, guys?
- All right, Jen?

97
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,443
Ohhhhh... God!

98
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,566
- Just writing a speech.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,163
- How's that going?
- Good, good, good, good, good, good.

100
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,647
You know, I was thinking...

101
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,845
if there's anything you guys want to say,
I can put it in, it's no problem.

102
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,245
Oh! Oh, yeah.
Hm, interesting.

103
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,001
Erm, is there anything you'd like to say
to the shareholders, Moss?

104
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,124
- Just say hi.
- Say hi from us.

105
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,491
- OK.
- I love this.

106
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,728
How many more times
is she going to come in?

107
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,969
Maybe it'd be a good idea
if you two contributed to this.

108
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,048
Oh, yeah? Why?

109
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,848
I think it would give you experience
in writing a speech for a public figure.

110
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,804
Well, obviously,
in our line of work that would be handy.

111
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,164
But you know what, Jen?
I'm actually snowed under here.

112
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,922
Wait a second. Wait a second!

113
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,520
- Oh! Oh, what are we doing?!
- Huh?

114
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,961
- We should totally write that speech!
- Why?

115
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,321
- OK, offer to write the speech for Jen.
- No.

116
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,727
She'll know something's up if I do it.

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,888
- You have to do it.
- Why would I do that?

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,367
- Moss, do you trust me?
- No.

119
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,003
- Do you trust me?
- No.

120
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,566
If you trust me,
then offer to write that speech.

121
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,728
I. Don't. Trust. You.

122
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,888
Hello?

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,368
I feel really bad,
having all the fun writing this speech.

124
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,528
Do it.
Offer, offer, offer.

125
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,803
Well, I suppose we could write the speech

126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,402
so that, you know, you look like
you know what you're talking about.

127
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,967
Thanks. I'm off for lunch.
Leave it on my desk.

128
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,368
My God!

129
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,005
I know.

130
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,690
That's brilliant!

131
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,122
So now you understand
why we have to write that speech for Jen.

132
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,607
She will say anything we tell her to.

133
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,721
She will say anything we tell her to.

134
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,402
We can put any old bollocks in that speech,
and she shall repeat it.

135
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,046
It's going to be hilarious.

136
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,084
Sometimes I could kiss your mind, Roy!

137
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,681
OK, so let's just... I don't know,
let's just throw around a few ideas.

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,087
- OK, let's do it.
- OK.

139
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,809
Ooh! Could we tell her that there's
an apple inside every Apple Mac?

140
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,928
- It's good.
- Yeah.

141
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,602
We could say that Bill Gates is called
Bill Gates because he owns a lot of gates.

142
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,883
Hm! That's good.
It's not quite punchy enough.

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,166
And it's probably true now anyway -
I'll bet he does own a lot of gates.

144
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,851
He probably does.

145
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,210
It's got to be something big.

146
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,891
I think I may have it.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,650
What?

148
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,001
You best put seatbelts on your ears, Roy,

149
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,647
cos I'm going to take them
for the ride of their lives.

150
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,521
- Delightful.
- Oh, no, no, no. You're silly.

151
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,282
Do you know, I've never been
so enchanted by a woman in all my life.

152
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,563
What's your name again?
I know you told me.

153
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,091
- April.
- Ah, what a charming name.

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,851
Always been one of my favourites.

155
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,047
April... after dinner, would you do me
the honour of accompanying me to my bed?

156
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,164
- Oh. Erm...
- No, I've said too much!

157
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,205
I've let my heart overpower my head,
which is my wont.

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,322
But I don't care.
I find you enchanting.

159
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,088
And there's a condom machine
in the toilet - I've checked.

160
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,769
I'm very flattered, Douglas, but, erm...
there's a problem, something I should tell you.

161
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,963
- Go on.
- Erm...

162
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,242
I-I have a secret.

163
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,206
I could dance around the subject,
but I like you, I want to be straight with you.

164
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,129
Oh?

165
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,242
Erm...

166
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,727
I used to be a man, Douglas.

167
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,604
I used to be a man.

168
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,770
I wish there was an easier way of saying that,
but believe me, there's not.

169
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,522
I've had a lot of hormone therapy
and a number of operations.

170
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,565
I'm really sorry.
I... I hope you don't feel I deceived you.

171
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,286
I understand if you would rather I left.

172
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,290
I don't care.

173
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,564
What?!

174
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,648
Doesn't bother me.

175
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,002
Doesn't bother you at all?

176
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,407
It takes all sorts to make a world.

177
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,646
Wow!

178
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,127
- It bothers most men.
- I'm not most men.

179
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,811
And the offer still stands.

180
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,685
Are you up for it?

181
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,728
Oh!

182
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,969
Amazing! Just amazing.

183
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,802
- You liked it?
- You really know your way around that area.

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,411
Well...

185
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,524
Tell me,
what are you doing tomorrow night, April?

186
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,530
I was thinking of staying in
and watching the darts.

187
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,211
You've read my mind.

188
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,208
What is it?

189
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,642
This, Jen... is the internet.

190
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,008
- What?
- That's right.

191
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,088
This is the internet?

192
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,569
- The whole internet?
- Yep.

193
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,480
I asked for a loan of it
so that you could use it in your speech.

194
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,888
- It's so small!
- That's one of the surprising things about it.

195
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,530
Hang on, it doesn't have
any wires or anything.

196
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,802
It's wireless.

197
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,526
Oh, yes, everything's wireless
nowadays, isn't it?

198
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,450
I can really use it in my speech?
What if someone needs it?

199
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,723
People will still be able to go online.
It will still work.

200
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,524
Oh, good.

201
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,411
I tell you, you present this to the shareholders
and you will get quite a response.

202
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,888
Can I touch it?

203
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,244
Oh! It's so light!

204
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,170
Of course it is.
The internet doesn't weigh anything.

205
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,124
No, of course it doesn't.

206
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,649
Hey!

207
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,809
What is Jen doing with the internet?!

208
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,564
- Moss said I could use it for my speech.
- Are you insane?!

209
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,729
- What if she drops it?
- I won't drop it. I'll look after it.

210
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,330
No! No, no, no, no, no, Jen.

211
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,525
No, this... this needs to go
straight back to Big Ben.

212
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,689
- Big Ben?
- Yep, it goes on top of Big Ben.

213
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,121
That's where you get the best reception.

214
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,926
- I promise I won't let anything happen to it.
- No, Jen, I'm sorry.

215
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,408
The elders of the internet
would never stand for it.

216
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,729
No, Roy, I spoke to the elders of the internet
not one hour ago.

217
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,320
I told them about Jen winning
Employee of the Month.

218
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,445
They were so impressed that they wanted
to do whatever they could to help.

219
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,285
Wait a minute!
The elders of the internet?

220
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,607
The elders of the internet know who I am?!

221
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,166
You've got to let me have it!

222
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,408
No, Jen.
I'm sorry, it's just too risky.

223
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,761
- Oh, please, Roy?
- Oh...

224
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,568
Well... Moss, has it been
completely demagnetised?

225
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,090
By Stephen Hawking himself.

226
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,647
Who sends his congratulations,
by the way.

227
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,969
Well, if it's OK with the Hawk...

228
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,768
So can I have it?

229
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,848
You can.

230
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,401
- Oh, don't forget your speech.
- Thank you.

231
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,171
- Shh!
- Shh!

232
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,008
Slowly.

233
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,883
April, these past few days
have been like a dream.

234
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,329
Usually, I can't wait to get away
from a woman once I've ejaculated.

235
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,210
But with you...
I don't know, I feel alive.

236
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,927
- April, I love you.
- What?!

237
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,522
That's right.
I totally love the bloody arse off you.

238
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,407
Oh, Douglas, I love you too!

239
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,087
Oh, poppet... to think when we met
you were so worried that you came from Iran.

240
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,960
- What?
- When we met.

241
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,447
As if I'd be worried
about something like that.

242
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,211
I don't care where you're from -
Iran, France...

243
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,085
Doesn't bother me.
I'm very modern.

244
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,851
I'm not from Iran.

245
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,361
Well, you said
something along those lines.

246
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,769
No, not "Iran", "a man".
I said, "I used to be a man."

247
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,242
You used to be a man?!

248
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,129
Yes!

249
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,128
Oh, God!

250
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,562
Well, we have a very interesting talk
lined up for today.

251
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,526
Our Employee of the Month
and computer expert Jen Barber

252
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,725
has kindly agreed to say a few words
about her role in the IT department.

253
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,567
Speaking as someone
who doesn't know the difference

254
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,049
between a laptop and, erm...
the larger one,

255
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,323
I'm certainly looking forward
to hearing what she has to say.

256
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,041
Good morning.

257
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,644
When I was asked to give a speech
about what it is I do and everything...

258
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,409
I was very excited.

259
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,488
"At last," I thought,

260
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,085
"a chance to explain
the wonders of technology to... ordinary folk."

261
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,646
But then I thought,
"Who wants to listen to a boring old speech?"

262
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,687
Wouldn't it be better if I could actually
bring one of these wonders in to show you?

263
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,850
Say, I don't know... the internet.

264
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,201
I think it would, and I have.

265
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,928
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to present to you... the internet!

266
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,046
Oh, please, no flash photography.
You'll harm the internet.

267
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,091
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Why is no one laughing?

268
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,806
...If anything were to happen to this box,

269
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,084
the world as we know it
would fall into chaos,

270
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,044
planes would drop from the sky like tables,

271
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,200
society would tear itself apart
like an angry child with a napkin.

272
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,450
Man's primeval instinct to survive at any cost
would lead to terrible violence.

273
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,602
So, please, no flash photography.

274
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,282
I must say,
this is all very impressive, Douglas.

275
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,449
- So what exactly are you working on?
- I don't know.

276
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,481
April... we need to talk.

277
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,841
Oh, darling,
couldn't we do this at home?

278
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,964
I was hoping we could get shitfaced
and watch the telly.

279
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,323
There'll no more getting shitfaced
and watching the telly,

280
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,284
there'll be no more Steven Seagal marathons,

281
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,131
and there'll be no more
paintballing weekends.

282
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,211
I'm afraid our adventure
has come to an end.

283
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,325
- What?! But... but why?
- It's not you, it's me.

284
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,488
No, actually,
it's not me, it is you.

285
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,489
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,843
- You don't think of me as a woman, do you?
- What? Of course I do.

287
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,362
- It bothers you that I used to be a man!
- No!

288
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,643
I love that you used to be a man -
it's your thing.

289
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,491
I love thinking about
that operation that you had.

290
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,844
Oh, please!
Look at me - I am a woman.

291
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,521
- This is a woman in front of you!
- Excuse me.

292
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,768
I am a woman!

293
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,206
- You're tearing me apart.
- Please, Douglas.

294
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,681
I'm sorry, it's beyond my control.

295
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,485
Please, Douglas. Please!

296
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,161
Just go.
You're making this harder for me.

297
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,890
You...!

298
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,287
How could you do this?

299
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,051
How could you do this to me?!

300
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,728
You bastard!

301
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,491
...and that's what the flashing light is for.

302
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,568
- Any more?
- Is it heavy?

303
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,481
Is it... That's a bit of a silly question -
the internet doesn't weigh anything.

304
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,443
Well, OK, guys,
I guess I should wrap it up.

305
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,689
- Aw...
- No, no, I really have to finish up.

306
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,565
More! More! More!
More! More! More!

307
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,687
Guys!
Oh, my God, you really like me.

308
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,644
- This really isn't that funny.
- I know. It's terrible.

309
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,810
I thought at least we'd get a good story
out of it, something we'd remember.

310
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,927
It's over, April!

311
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,328
Jesus!

312
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,647
The internet!

313
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,611
We're all going to die!

314
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,886
Everybody stay calm.

315
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,921
Wait for me! Wait!

316
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,564
He needs to hold his nerve now.

317
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,170
He's done it.

318
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,681
But it's not the same!

319
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,168
Oh, April!
