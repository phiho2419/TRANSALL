1
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,523
<i>You wouldn't steal a handbag.</i>

2
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,325
<i>You wouldn't steal a car.</i>

3
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,727
<i>You wouldn't steal a baby.</i>

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,608
<i>You wouldn't shoot a policeman</i>

5
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,724
<i>and then steal his helmet.</i>

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,561
<i>You wouldn't go to the toilet in his helmet</i>

7
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,129
<i>and then send it
to the policeman's grieving widow,</i>

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,289
<i>and then steal it again.</i>

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,289
<i>Downloading films is stealing.</i>

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,882
<i>If you do it,
you will face the consequences.</i>

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,130
Man, these anti-piracy ads
are getting really mean.

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,449
I think we're sitting too close to the screen.
And the floor's all sticky over here.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,723
All right. OK, let's move back, then.

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,367
Ah!

15
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,290
- I still think we're too close.
- Well, then, sit in the sink.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
I'm not sitting in the sink again.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,048
OK, princess.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,242
Your flat is way too small for this telly.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,408
That's nonsense.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,447
- What's wrong with you now?
- I need to go to the toilet.

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,767
Well, then, go.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,970
I'll hold it in.

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,285
- Hello?
- Hello, Roy.

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,561
Hello, Jeff.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,331
Now, Roy, you know
I changed my name by deed poll.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,728
- I'm not calling you Dominator, Jeff.
- But I am Dominator!

27
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,081
- Yeah, whatever. I'm not calling you it.
- Forget it.

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,171
Um... Now, listen, I was just wondering,
have you seen the new Tarantino film?

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,047
- Yeah, actually I'm just about to watch it.
- I have already seen it.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,891
Anyway, right, at the end,
there's a very unusual twist.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,684
Oh!

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,362
Oh, no!

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,802
Oh, now I know there's a twist! I'm gonna
spend the whole film guessing what it is.

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,843
Damn you, Dominator.

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,090
- Just try and forget that there's a twist.
- Oh, how can you forget there's a twist?

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,682
Oh, what's wrong with it now? Oh, come on!

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,646
If I don't see this film today then Jeff'll find
out some way of telling me what the twist is.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,082
I know he will. Come on! Work!

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,048
Oh, look, I have to go.

40
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,128
Moss.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,962
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. What's up with you?
- I can't do this any more.

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,562
Do what? Moss, what are you talking about?
Here, let me help...

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,604
- Back off.
- We're just watching a film, Moss.

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,848
- Come on, Roy. Can't you see it?
- See what, Moss?

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,770
We go to a film, sometimes the pub,
maybe get some dinner,

46
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,441
but it just goes on and on, year
in, year out. We're stagnating.

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,006
You're making it sound
like we're some sort of old married couple.

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,489
But we are. Can't you see? You're my wife,
Roy, you're my wife. You're my wife.

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,126
We should be married to ladies,
but we're married to each other.

50
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,440
- You're my wife.
- Could you stop calling me your wife?

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,802
You're my wife, Roy,
and I can't take it any more!

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,767
If anything, I'm the husband.

53
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,007
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this? What's this?

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,521
- Oh, come on.
- We don't even have ventilation down here.

55
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,484
- I'll stand over here.
- I don't care. No.

56
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,891
I don't wanna go out on the street.
It's too... Soviet out there.

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,921
- "Soviet"?
- Yes. It's cold, everyone looks oppressed.

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,204
You know, I remember when smoking was fun.
All the cool kids were doing it.

59
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,642
Every time I want a cigarette now
I have to go to Gorky Park.

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,649
Oh, don't answer that.

61
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,091
- Why not?
- I know who that is.

62
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,771
That's a man called Dominator
who wants to tell me the twist in a film

63
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,803
that I've been waiting to see for ages.
Don't answer it.

64
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,764
- "Dominator"?
- His real name is Jeff Hawthorne.

65
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,840
- We have to answer the phone.
- No, no, we don't.

66
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
No, look... he'll give up in a second.
I know Jeff.

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,609
He'll need to go to the toilet
in about another two rings.

68
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,681
- We're answering the phone.
- We are not answering the phones.

69
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,289
- You all right, Moss?
- I've got the blues, Jen.

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,287
Why?

71
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,563
Well, Roy and I are becoming
like an old married couple.

72
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,571
Will you please stop saying that?
And I'm the husband!

73
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,331
We just seem to do the same thing
day in, day out.

74
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,922
I'm stagnating, Jen,
like a packet of crisps on the roof.

75
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,283
It seems to me the problem is
that you two spend too much time together.

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,721
You should get out there
and meet other people.

77
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,127
Other people?

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,810
Yes.

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,245
- You mean people other than Roy?
- Well, yes.

80
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,046
And these "other people",
where do they congregate?

81
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,322
I don't know, you could try
and do an evening class.

82
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,201
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second now.
And what exactly am I supposed to do

83
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,766
while she's out gallivanting
at her night classes and whatnot?

84
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,602
- Well, you could meet other people as well.
- Yeah... I don't like people.

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,122
Oh, well, now, that's not fair, Roy.
Have you met all of them?

86
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,242
I've met enough of them.

87
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,729
People! What a bunch of bastards.

88
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,811
Stephanie. Yes, hello.

89
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,922
Oh, of course. OK. Bye.

90
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,202
Ooh. I'm off.

91
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,607
- Douglas is coming down.
- Douglas? Why?

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,883
Well, to be honest with you,
he's been making advances.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,005
You know, little things like asking me
if I wanna go for a ride in his helicopter.

94
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,967
- Oh, I'd like to go for a ride in a helicopter.
- Well, grow a pair of tits.

95
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,527
Tell you what, if I did have tits I wouldn't
mind letting someone have a go on them

96
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,371
for a ride in a helicopter.

97
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,047
Look who it is, everyone. It's only me.

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,125
Jen, do you have a moment?

99
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,687
No, I don't, I'm very busy. I don't
wanna go for a ride in the helicopter.

100
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,689
That wasn't what I was gonna ask, actually.

101
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,690
- What do you want, then?
- Um...

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,962
Something, uh, work-related.

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,604
- What department is this?
- Sorry?

104
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,281
Well, if it's work-related then obviously
you'll know what department this is.

105
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,051
What department is this?

106
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,890
Some sort of, uh... homosexual department?

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,207
- IT! It's IT!
- IT!

108
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,324
I knew that, yes.
That's what I wanted, actually.

109
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,968
You see, my computer's broken
and I need someone to fix it.

110
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,845
- Roy's your man.
- Oh.

111
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,570
How you fellas get any work done with a hot
piece of finger-licking chicken like that.

112
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,207
Me, I'd be a 24-hour tripod.

113
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,890
What's this? It looks good.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,402
Um... yeah. I've actually been
really looking forward to seeing this.

115
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,330
Yeah? You wanna come round to mine?
We can watch it there.

116
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,727
I've got a pretty nifty home cinema system.

117
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,680
Um... well, mine is broken, but I think
that maybe I'll just watch it...

118
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,405
Well, excellent. That's settled then.
Seven o'clock tonight.

119
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,047
I'll get my PA to phone you
with my name and address.

120
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,288
<i>Ciao.</i>

121
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,088
Whoa, there. That's not my office.
<i>Ciao.</i>

122
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,648
Well, what's good for the goose
is good for the gander. And I'm the gander!

123
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,161
I hear the ballet
in Prague is excellent this season.

124
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,682
- Hello, Jorg.
- Hello, Jen.

125
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,804
Terrible, isn't it?
Every year it gets worse.

126
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,207
First
they take away our smoking room,

127
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,561
then they push us outside.

128
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,729
I wonder when they will decide
just to get it over with and kill us.

129
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,289
Oh, Jorg, such a pessimist.

130
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,205
- Has he gone?
- Has who gone?

131
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,766
- Bruce Wayne.
- Oh, he's long gone.

132
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,043
Although Roy's got a man date with him.

133
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,369
It is not a man date.
I am not a man-woman.

134
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,165
We are not married.
I am not your wife!

135
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,368
- You'd willingly spend time with Douglas?
- I really have to see this film soon.

136
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,571
Oh, by the way, I took your advice
about those evening classes.

137
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,207
- I'm going to learn how to cook.
- Oh, I'm so pleased, Moss.

138
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,482
And I have to say, women do love a cook.

139
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,090
Well, answered an ad online.

140
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,000
This time next month, when you want
German cuisine, I'm your man.

141
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,602
- German cuisine?
- Is German cuisine not good?

142
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,370
No. Sounds fine.

143
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,042
There's nothing more romantic than
a glass of wine and some <i>Schweinefleisch.</i>

144
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,330
Good, because usually when I try
something new it ends up a disaster.

145
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,408
Oh!

146
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,807
I got a reply
to my advertisement.

147
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,321
Maurice Moss.

148
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,161
Mm. He sounds delicious!

149
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,524
Ah! <i>GutenAbend!</i> I mean, hello.

150
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,611
- Hello. I'm Moss.
- Yes, yes, yes. I'm Johann. Come in, come in.

151
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,246
- Oh. Nice TV.
- Ah.

152
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,681
Good distance from the sofa.

153
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,246
Um... Would you...
would you like a drink?

154
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,648
- Oh, yes. White Russian, please.
- I don't know that. How do you make that?

155
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,967
I don't know.

156
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,166
- Well, we might as well get to it.
- Really? Gosh. So eager, so brave.

157
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,046
Well, you know, once I've made up my mind
to do something, that's it.

158
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,446
Oh, that's very admirable.

159
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,325
So, really, just do whatever you want
with me. I'm ready for anything.

160
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,521
Ah!

161
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,041
Well, right. Ah, well... I suppose...

162
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,846
- Take your clothes off and we'll get started.
- Right.

163
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,564
- So, how long does this course last?
- Uh, sorry?

164
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,287
- How long does this course last?
- Course? What course?

165
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,961
- Hang on. Take my clothes off?
- Yes.

166
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,289
- Sorry. I'm confused.
- Well, so am I.

167
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,849
- What did you think this was?
- Well... I was going to eat you.

168
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,121
I may have misheard you there. Did you
just say that you were going to eat me?

169
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,242
- Yes.
- Right, you did say that.

170
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,600
Yes.

171
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,122
- Yeah, no, I'm here for the cookery.
- No, no, no, this is the cookery.

172
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,883
- Look, I've got your advert here.
- Yes.

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,482
- I printed it out.
- Yes.

174
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,208
- "I want to cook with you."
- Ah, no, no. My English is not so good. Um...

175
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,163
Oh, right!

176
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,124
You want to cook with me,
using me, you mean.

177
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,005
- Ah, yes! Yes! You see?
- Yes, yes.

178
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,728
I see where the confusion was.
I thought this was a cookery course.

179
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,727
No, no.

180
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,287
But you were looking for someone who would
agree to let you kill and eat them.

181
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,402
<i>Ja.Ja.</i>

182
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,931
- You see?
- That is funny.

183
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,087
<i>Ja.</i>

184
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,923
So... you're not interested?

185
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,566
Oh, no, thanks very much.
It's not for me.

186
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,644
How disappointing.

187
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,321
I'm sorry, Johann.
This must be such a letdown.

188
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,285
Ohh! I had my tonsils out last month.
I could've kept them.

189
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,368
Oh!

190
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,610
I feel like such a turnip.

191
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,047
- Do you want to watch a film?
- OK.

192
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,448
- I have <i>Ocean's Eleven.</i>
- Original or remake?

193
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,367
Well, yeah, you could come over here.

194
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,042
We could put on some music, I could
give you a back rub, see what happens.

195
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,369
Oh, no, wait, I've got this guy coming over
to watch a DVD.

196
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,244
Another time, maybe. OK.

197
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,569
Oh, and some chicken wings, please.
Thank you.

198
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,448
Ah!

199
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,771
There's somebody at the door.
There's somebody at the door.

200
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,247
There's somebody at the door.

201
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,766
Hey, it's my G.

202
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,963
Um... I'm really sorry I was late.
It was...

203
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,005
It's cool, dude. Hey, you know,
we should do this sort of thing more often.

204
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,408
I hate the whole boss/employee thing,
don't you?

205
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,646
Yeah.

206
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,082
You wanna seal the deal with a high-five?

207
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,362
Yes.

208
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,004
So, what are we watching?

209
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,488
It's a Tarantino-produced
South Korean zombie movie.

210
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,050
Wow, I didn't know there was a <i>South</i> Korea.
OK, put it on.

211
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,128
I've ordered pizza and chicken wings,

212
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,084
and there's a cooler beside you,
so help yourself to beer.

213
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,168
Don't mind if I do.

214
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,483
Oh, I've heard of this flick.
There's a twist in it, isn't there?

215
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,207
Yeah. Just... just try and forget that

216
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,290
and hopefully we'll still
be able to enjoy it.

217
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,243
I bet he's a woman, that bloke.

218
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,206
No, you think it's the future
but it's actually set in the past.

219
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,846
It's not Earth. It's all a dream.

220
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,364
Oh, could you not... could you... Could
you not try and guess what the twist is?

221
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,611
It's just that might get a little annoying.

222
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,246
But isn't that half the fun,
trying to guess the twist?

223
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,766
Uh... Personally, I think it...
it kind of... it ruins the fun.

224
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,680
- Well, I think it makes it more fun.
- It's just I don't.

225
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,768
Well, I do.

226
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,611
And I'm the boss.

227
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,166
I'm your boss.

228
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,648
They're all clones.
He's his own brother.

229
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,808
Everyone's a ghost.

230
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,602
- Have you still not seen the film yet?
- No!

231
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,043
- What's that?
- What?

232
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,926
It's cold, and I'm going
out for a cigarette.

233
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,442
Morning.
Oh, you must be Jen's mother.

234
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,121
- What a night I had last night.
- Oh, yes, the cookery. How was it?

235
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,884
I am so embarrassed, I cannot tell you.

236
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,721
- What happened?
- It wasn't a cookery class at all.

237
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,285
What was it?

238
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,926
He wrote it down wrong
cos his English isn't very good.

239
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,166
Always the way.

240
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,808
And it turns out he didn't want
to teach me <i>how to</i> cook,

241
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,161
he wanted to cook <i>me.</i>

242
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,209
What?

243
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,763
He wanted to eat me.

244
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,249
I know - egg and my face were in alignment.

245
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,963
- He wanted to eat you?
- Yes.

246
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,803
He's one of those German cannibals.

247
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,242
- He is, and he was such a nice man.
- Oh, was he?

248
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,330
Yeah. He was a fine young cannibal.

249
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,642
- Hang on, hang on, h-he wanted to eat you?
- Yeah, keep up, Jen.

250
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,766
So we had a laugh about it, and in the end,
I didn't really feel like being eaten

251
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,008
so we just watched <i>Ocean's Eleven.</i>

252
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,647
- Ah. Original or remake?
- Is that really the most important question?

253
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,525
I... Hang on. You watched a...
you watched a film with him?

254
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,608
- Yes.
- With the man that wanted to eat you?

255
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,564
- Who else are we talking about?
- Why didn't you call the police?

256
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,843
- The police? Why would I call the police?
- He wanted to eat you!

257
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,567
Only with my consent and, believe me,
my consent was not forthcoming.

258
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,684
- Good for you, Moss.
- But...

259
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,010
- Eating people is illegal.
- Only without their consent.

260
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,010
- No, Moss. No, no, no.
- It's a Grey area, give me that.

261
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,170
I knew something was askew.
Whoever heard of German food?

262
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,404
But you should see his place, it's incredible.
He's got a great system, 50-inch TV.

263
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,648
Really?

264
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,003
Maybe we could watch the film at his place.

265
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,125
Oh, I don't know, Roy. He's only really
interested in people he can eventually eat.

266
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,447
Oh. Tell him he can eat me.

267
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,609
Are... are you insane?
You've got to call the police.

268
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,284
Oh, Jen, don't be such an old fuddy-duddy.
The world has changed.

269
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,450
If two grown men can't make a pervert happy
for a few minutes

270
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,291
in order to watch a film about zombies,

271
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,246
then maybe we should all just move to Iran.

272
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,887
I don't know, Roy. It does seem
a little immoral to mislead him.

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,848
But, then, as Jen pointed out earlier,
being a cannibal's a little immoral too.

274
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,964
I'm in an ethical pickle.

275
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,325
Turns out meeting new people is a lot more
complicated than I'd originally thought.

276
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,725
- <i>Jen.</i>
- Jorg.

277
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,968
What are you doing?
You cannot smoke here.

278
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,369
- They are moving us to a new smoking area.
- Oh, so the rumours were true.

279
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,324
Come quick, before they see you.

280
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,126
- Jen, what are you doing?
- It's over, Jorg.

281
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,803
We must fight them, Jen.
We must all fight them.

282
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,207
We must keep smoking until the bitter end.

283
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,004
Jorg.

284
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,442
Jorg, such fire.

285
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,167
I am too tired for revolution.

286
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,124
And we've walked miles.

287
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,007
Goodbye, Jorg.

288
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,921
Taxi!

289
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,083
- Let's not fight again.
- No.

290
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,127
- And, look, we're out, we're meeting people.
- Yes.

291
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,004
Oh.

292
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,130
- You were a bit wonky.
- Thanks, dear.

293
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,523
Hello!

294
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,486
- Hello! How wonderful!
- Johann, this is Roy. Roy, this is Johann.

295
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,080
Hello, Johann. I brought dessert.

296
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,726
Ah! Come in, come in.

297
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,251
<i>Ja.</i>

298
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,604
- Oh, this is lovely.
- Yes. Yes. Lovely.

299
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,370
- Oh, isn't this nice?
- Yeah.

300
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,529
OK, so we'll watch the film and then
I'll just tell him I changed my mind.

301
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,369
- Ah!
- Lovely, isn't it?

302
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,405
Oh, wow. Now that's a guitar.

303
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,127
So, Roy, h-has Moss explained to you
my, um... desires?

304
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,846
- He has indeed.
- And are you interested?

305
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,442
- I'm very interested.
- Ah, splendid!

306
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,131
Moss, if you will excuse us.

307
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,926
- Do you eat in here?
- Yes, this way, please.

308
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,045
But, Roy, didn't you want to watch
this film that I have here?

309
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,811
Oh, I'd completely forgotten.

310
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,005
There was that film that I wanted
to watch before Johann ate me.

311
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,487
- That's right.
- There it is there now.

312
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,921
- Yes.
- So, you... so, you want to watch a film?

313
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,724
- Yes, thanks.
- Is that OK?

314
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,640
- Uh... Yes, yes, of course.
- I'll put it on.

315
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,169
Is it very long?

316
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,487
- Two hours 20.
- Oh!

317
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,689
Hm... No, I'll wait.

318
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,566
- <i>You wouldn't steal a handbag...</i>
- These piracy warnings!

319
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,650
I know! Very bad.

320
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,525
Oh, what now?

321
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,166
<i>You wouldn't shoot a policeman
and then steal his helmet...</i>

322
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,931
- Hello, there.
- Yes? Can I help you?

323
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,168
- Police! Don't move!
- Don't move!

324
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,840
If my mother thinks I'm a cannibal,
I'll be for the high jump.

325
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,531
Oh, for once can we please
not bring your mother into it?

326
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,642
Oh, here we go again.

327
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,961
Well, boys...

328
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,448
we're in a bit of a sticky
situation, aren't we?

329
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,409
Where did you get this film?

330
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,242
This is an illegal copy of a film.

331
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,683
Um...

332
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,280
Are you not worried
that we might be cannibals?

333
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,004
Cannibals?

334
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,162
The man who was with us is a cannibal.
He was going to eat me.

335
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,365
Well, it's not really my area. I do
copyright violation, that sort of thing.

336
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,563
But I'll let someone know, thanks.
Anyway...

337
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,967
Where did you get this?

338
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,206
Interesting film.

339
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,325
Who'd have thought at the end
that bloke turned out to be the... Oof!

340
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,560
Bravo!

341
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,528
Bravo!
